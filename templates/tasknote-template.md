## 📝 Phase 1: Discovery

- [ ] Reviewed the task entry in PLAN.md

- [ ] **Relevance Assessment**

  **Verdict:** Proceed | Re-scope | De-scope
  **Rationale:**

- [ ] Read relevant source files

- [ ] **Best Practices Review** — for code or module-boundary work, identified touched responsibilities, dependency direction, existing abstractions, nearby duplication, and any required in-scope refactor or deferred cleanup (otherwise `N/A` with reason)

- [ ] **Archive skim** — skim `.flowtron/tasknote/archive/<area>/` for prior tasknotes that touched the source paths in scope; log relevant findings in Discovery Notes before re-interpreting the task

- [ ] **Drift check** — file paths, line numbers, function names, and root-cause hypotheses cited in the task description still match current code; flag any drift before re-interpreting the task

- [ ] Asked clarifying questions OR logged "No clarifications needed" with explicit assumptions

- [ ] Subtasks above populated with concrete, ordered steps

**Discovery Notes:**

## 🛠️ Phase 2: Execution

- [ ] **Pattern survey** — extended an established pattern or justified a new shape; checked DRY and single-responsibility (SRP) boundaries; preferred composition when it reduced coupling

- [ ] **Minimal refactor gate** — refactored only for Acceptance or to prevent duplication, obscured responsibility, or a dependency-boundary violation in the touched path; recorded the reason and deferred unrelated cleanup

- [ ] Implemented the minimal solution

- [ ] Updated/added tests for non-trivial behavior

**Implementation Notes:**

## 🧪 Phase 3: Testing & Linting

- [ ] Ran targeted test suite for changed code

- [ ] Ran lint/type-check on changed code

- [ ] **Quality assertions** — for changed code, confirmed no avoidable duplication, dead code, unexplained complexity, unnecessary public-surface growth, or stale code-facing documentation (otherwise `N/A` with reason)

- [ ] (frontend) Asked the user for visual confirmation (👁️ prefix on the prose ask)

> **Choosing a test strategy (guidance, not a gate).** Default to targeted
> tests on the changed behavior. Where the input space is wide — parsers,
> encoders, round-trips, invariants that must hold across many inputs — a
> property-based test earns its keep; reach for one when example tests would
> leave large gaps. Visual confirmation covers UI surfaces that assertions
> can't. This is engineering judgment folded into Phase 3, never a new
> lifecycle phase or a schema/validator.

**Testing Notes:**

## 🚀 Phase 4: Closure

- [ ] **Doc-drift sweep** — for each entry in `.flowtron/tasknote/README.md` §"AI-referenced docs", state "no change" or the update

- [ ] Closed — every `## ✅ Acceptance` criterion ticked or explicitly annotated (`N/A` / not-met with a one-line reason), YAML `status:` flipped to `completed`, PLAN.md line flipped to stub form `Completed YYYY-MM-DD.` and placed per SPEC/tasknote-selection.md §"`## Completed` archive convention" (standalone → top of `## Completed`; epic child → kept nested beneath its active parent), then tasknote moved to `.flowtron/tasknote/archive/<area>/`

- [ ] **Evidence-based recap** drafted — changed files/LOC where meaningful, verification commands/results, refactors made or deferred with rationale, documentation verdict, and concrete maintainability effect (surfaces at the 📦 ready-to-commit gate, or inline on conditional skip)

**Final Summary:**

**Archived:** YYYY-MM-DD
