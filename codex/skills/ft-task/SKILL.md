# ft-task - Codex wrapper

Read and follow `../../../SPEC/procedures/ft-task.md` first. It is the agent-neutral execution SOP for this workflow.

If the SOP does not cover a needed edge case, read `../../../claude/skills/ft-task/SKILL.md`, applying the Codex translation rules in `../../AGENTS-snippet.md` §"Translation rules" — plus one rule specific to this wrapper: load lazy fragments from `../../../claude/skills/ft-task/` only when the source dispatch says they apply.
