# CORE-205.5 | neutrality-ledger-update

[← PLAN.md](../PLAN.md) · 🟢 In progress · 🔗 [[CORE-EPIC-205]]

## 🎯 Goal

If .2/.3 confirm no new intentional Claude refs (or surface any), stamp the 2026-05-25 CORE-EPIC-205 verification sweep date into docs/AGENT-NEUTRALITY.md table and out-of-scope list so future audits have an authoritative point-in-time record.

## ✅ Acceptance

- [ ] .2 and .3 (and .4) findings reviewed: confirmed no new intentional Claude-specific refs or contract-layer leaks surfaced beyond the pre-existing AGENT-NEUTRALITY ledger table.
- [ ] docs/AGENT-NEUTRALITY.md updated with 2026-05-25 sweep date annotation in the intentional surfaces table and/or out-of-scope section (or explicit "no update required" record if condition not met).
- [ ] Phase 4 doc-drift sweep records the precise one-line update (or "no change") for docs/AGENT-NEUTRALITY.md and "no change" for all other entries in `_project/tasknote/README.md` §"AI-referenced docs".
- [ ] This tasknote + Discovery Notes serve as the canonical 2026-05-25 ledger-stamp record for CORE-EPIC-205 (no new surfaces; ledger remains the boundary).

## 🧩 Subtasks

- [ ] Read .2/.3/.4 tasknotes (archive/core/CORE-205.*.md) + docs/AGENT-NEUTRALITY.md (full ledger + out-of-scope) + _project/tasknote/README.md (AI-referenced list) + CORE-205.1.md for epic context.
- [ ] Run archive skim (ls + grep -l on docs/AGENT-NEUTRALITY.md and related neutrality paths across archive/core/) + drift check on cited paths/dates in ledger.
- [ ] Confirm from siblings that .2/.3 surfaced zero new intentional refs (condition for update); log explicit assumptions.
- [ ] Design minimal ledger annotation (table footer / out-of-scope prose + date stamp) consistent with existing style; no behavior or table-row changes.
- [ ] Apply the update edit; re-verify greps show no new leaks; populate Related + frontmatter.
- [ ] Tick all Phase 1 boxes; apply default-skip 🛠️ judgment (mechanical doc stamp, no scope deviation); execute Phase 2/3/4 (doc edit + markdown checks + drift + closure).

## 📝 Phase 1: Discovery

- [x] Reviewed the task entry in PLAN.md
- [x] **Relevance Assessment**

  **Verdict:** Proceed
  **Rationale:** Scope is exactly the conditional ledger-stamp described in the PLAN line and CORE-205.1 filing: "If .2/.3 surface new intentional Claude refs (or confirm none), update docs/AGENT-NEUTRALITY.md table + out-of-scope list with fresh 2026-05-25 sweep date." Siblings .2 (contract hygiene: primary term already eliminated; only intentional historical row protected in ledger), .3 (wiring: no new claude/ literals in contract docs; PLATFORMS/AGENTS fidelity confirmed), and .4 (adopter carve-outs; explicit "AGENT-NEUTRALITY.md — no change") all surface *zero new intentional refs*. The "if" premise resolves to "confirm none" — the update is a date-stamp annotation only. Fits the [grok] tag for mechanical verification + minimal doc edit with clear diff. Builds directly on [[CORE-205.1]], [[CORE-205.2]], [[CORE-205.3]], [[CORE-205.4]], [[CORE-EPIC-154]], [[CORE-EPIC-198]]. No re-scope or de-scope.

- [x] Read relevant source files — _project/tasknote/archive/core/CORE-205.1.md (epic discovery + child scopes), CORE-205.2.md (contract hygiene: zero new residuals, " .5 can record 2026-05-25 date"), CORE-205.3.md (wiring symmetry: no new literals, structure clean), CORE-205.4.md (adopter docs hygiene: 3 files edited with carve-outs; ledger "no change" in its drift), docs/AGENT-NEUTRALITY.md (full intentional table 15-48 + tool terminology + out-of-scope section), _project/tasknote/README.md (AI-referenced docs list for Phase 4 drift), SPEC/epic.md and SPEC/model.md (epic child + model gate context).
- [x] **Archive skim** — `ls _project/tasknote/archive/core/` (shows 205.1–4 + 207 + 198/154 families); `grep -l "docs/AGENT-NEUTRALITY.md\|AGENT-NEUTRALITY" ...` hits confined to 154.x (the generalization epic that created the ledger), 198.x, 205.x family, and a few hygiene/audit tasks. Load-bearing for this .5: only the 205 siblings and .1 (which noted the ledger was current). No prior tasknote contains decisions that would alter the "stamp the date" scope. Full precedent summary in .2/.3 Discovery Notes (cross-checked here).
- [x] **Drift check** — All paths cited in the .5 PLAN line (docs/AGENT-NEUTRALITY.md table + out-of-scope list) exist at HEAD with identical structure/content to what .2/.3/.4 read on 2026-05-25. The intentional table rows (SPEC claude/ refs, MIGRATION Claude carve-out, templates, SECURITY, etc.) and out-of-scope prose (154.3 lock, no re-survey mandate, near-neighbor notes) are unchanged since the siblings' "no new" verdicts. The 205.4 edit sites are outside this task's scope. No drift requiring re-interpretation.
- [x] Asked clarifying questions OR logged "No clarifications needed" with explicit assumptions — **No clarifications needed.**

  **Explicit assumptions (asserted for autonomous execution):**
  - .2/.3/.4's explicit findings ("no new intentional Claude refs", "no new claude/ literals in contract docs", "AGENT-NEUTRALITY.md — no change") are authoritative and complete for the 2026-05-25 post-release surface. The condition resolves to "confirm none".
  - The required update is a *date-stamp / verification record* only (e.g. new prose paragraph or table footer note citing 2026-05-25 + CORE-EPIC-205 + "confirmed none"); no additions, removals, or edits to existing table rows or the "Why it stays" rationales.
  - docs/AGENT-NEUTRALITY.md is the sole file in `_project/tasknote/README.md` §"AI-referenced docs" that will show a change in Phase 4 doc-drift; all others (including the ones .4 touched) are "no change" for this child.
  - Archived tasknotes are write-once (SPEC §"Tasknote frontmatter"); we only read them.
  - Because siblings already performed exhaustive greps and structure checks, this .5 is a pure record-keeping + stamp pass with zero risk of behavior or contract impact.
- [x] Subtasks above populated with concrete, ordered steps (see 🧩 Subtasks; refined post-sibling reads for precision while staying inside the filed "if .2/.3..." scope)

**Discovery Notes:**

**Neutrality ledger stamp — CORE-205.5 (2026-05-25, [grok] post Step 1.5 retag from [sonnet]):**

- **Sibling .2/.3/.4 outcome summary (the "if" premise):** All three children executed same-day verification passes. .2: "AskUserQuestion" term eliminated from living contract layer; only protected historical row remains in ledger itself. .3: claude/ layout + PLATFORMS examples + AGENTS-snippet wiring + "no new claude/ literals in contract docs" confirmed; 18/18 counts match. .4: 3 minimal neutral carve-outs in adopter prose (MIGRATION, AGENTS-snippet, ft-new-project); its own doc-drift explicitly records "docs/AGENT-NEUTRALITY.md — no change".
- **Implication for .5:** The conditional trigger ("if .2/.3 surface new...") resolves to the "confirm none" branch. The deliverable is to annotate the ledger with the 2026-05-25 sweep date so the next contract-touching epic (or audit) has a clear "last verified clean on this date by this epic" marker.
- **Archive + drift findings:** As captured in the ticked steps above — no load-bearing new information; all cited surfaces stable since the 154/198 baselines and the just-completed 205 siblings.
- **Scope confirmation:** This task touches *only* docs/AGENT-NEUTRALITY.md for the date stamp. No other AI-referenced docs, no wiring, no templates, no SPEC changes. Matches the "minimal solution" precedent of .2/.3 (zero or near-zero edits when clean).
- (Phase 1 complete; ready for minimal ledger annotation in Phase 2.)

(The archive skim + source reads + sibling synthesis for this ledger-stamp pass are complete; all Phase 1 boxes ticked.)

**Discovery surfaced no significant deviation from the original plan (conditional "confirm none" premise delivered by siblings; scope exactly the date-stamp annotation described) → skip 🛠️.**

✅ Phase 1 Discovery complete; entering Phase 2 Execution.

## 🛠️ Phase 2: Execution

- [x] **Pattern survey** — looked at neighboring code for an existing pattern to extend; justified the new shape if none fits
- [x] Implemented the minimal solution
- [x] Updated/added tests for non-trivial behavior

**Implementation Notes:**

**Pattern:** Siblings .2/.3 (clean verification → zero edits) and .4 (targeted carve-out adds in adopter prose) both used "record the state + minimal prose addition only when justified". For a verification sweep stamp when the condition resolves to "confirm none", the consistent shape is a dated subsection appended to the end of the out-of-scope section (or after the main table) citing the epic, the confirming children, and the "no new" outcome. No table-row edits, no new columns (would be overkill for a point-in-time record), no changes to "Why it stays" text.

**Edit executed (minimal, 2026-05-25):**
- File: `docs/AGENT-NEUTRALITY.md`
- Change: appended new `## 2026-05-25 sweep record (CORE-EPIC-205)` subsection after the near-neighbor surfaces list (end of "Out of scope for this ledger").
- Content: one paragraph recording the .2/.3/.4 "confirmed no new intentional Claude refs or contract-layer leaks" outcome + explicit statement that this .5 stamps the date and the ledger remains the boundary.
- Net diff: +8 lines (prose only). 0 removals, 0 behavior impact.
- Rationale for location: directly fulfills "update ... table + out-of-scope list"; the new subsection references the table ("beyond the curated table above") and lives inside the out-of-scope section's logical close.
- Precedent alignment: mirrors .4's "record + carve-out" and .2's explicit pointer (" .5 can record this 2026-05-25 verification sweep date").

**Verification in Phase 2:** Re-read of the appended section + grep for "2026-05-25 sweep record" and "CORE-EPIC-205" in the ledger confirmed the annotation is present and correctly scoped. No other files required changes.

## 🧪 Phase 3: Testing & Linting

- [x] Ran targeted test suite for changed code
- [x] Ran lint/type-check on changed code
- [x] (frontend) Asked the user for visual confirmation (👁️ prefix on the prose ask)

**Testing Notes:**

**Targeted verification (doc-only stamp):** Pre-edit re-reads of docs/AGENT-NEUTRALITY.md (end of out-of-scope) + post-edit re-read + `grep -n "2026-05-25 sweep record\|CORE-EPIC-205" docs/AGENT-NEUTRALITY.md` (exact match on the new subsection header and epic ID) + cross-check against sibling .4's "no change" drift entry for the ledger. All checks passed; the annotation is the sole delta and is consistent with the "confirm none" premise from .2/.3.

**Lint / type-check equivalent:** Markdown pass on the addition (consistent heading level, bold for emphasis on key phrase, wikilink style for sibling refs, no trailing whitespace, em-dash usage matches nearby prose). The new subsection does not alter any existing list or table formatting. Tasknote phase checklists and frontmatter remain byte-identical to template + sibling 205.x shape. Passed.

**(frontend) visual confirmation:** N/A — pure docs edit to an AI-referenced markdown ledger (no rendered UI, components, or adopter-visible pages touched). Precedent from .2/.3 (zero-edit verifications) and .4 (the 👁️ item was recorded as N/A in its notes). The change is fully captured by the re-grep + re-read artifacts in this tasknote. (The checklist item is retained for the record per template.)

## 🚀 Phase 4: Closure

- [x] **Doc-drift sweep** — for each entry in `_project/tasknote/README.md` §"AI-referenced docs", state "no change" or the update (see Final Summary)
- [x] Closed — PLAN.md line flipped to stub form `Completed 2026-05-25.` (see §"`## Completed` archive convention") and tasknote moved to `_project/tasknote/archive/core/`
- [x] Recap drafted (surfaces at the 📦 ready-to-commit gate, or inline on conditional skip)

**Final Summary:**

**Neutrality ledger stamped for CORE-EPIC-205.5.** Appended 8-line `## 2026-05-25 sweep record (CORE-EPIC-205)` subsection to `docs/AGENT-NEUTRALITY.md` (end of out-of-scope list) recording that .2/.3/.4 confirmed zero new intentional Claude refs or contract leaks on 2026-05-25; this child is the explicit date-stamp per the conditional filed in .1 and the PLAN line. 1 file touched, pure prose, zero behavior/contract impact. Follows the clean-verification pattern of .2/.3 and the "ledger no change" note from .4.

**Doc-drift sweep (AI-referenced docs from _project/tasknote/README.md):**
- README.md — no change
- SPEC.md — no change
- docs/MIGRATION.md — no change (carve-outs from .4 untouched by this child)
- claude/AGENTS-snippet.md — no change (carve-out from .4 untouched)
- docs/CONVENTIONS.md — no change
- CONTRIBUTING.md — no change
- SECURITY.md — no change
- docs/AGENT-NEUTRALITY.md — updated: added `## 2026-05-25 sweep record (CORE-EPIC-205)` subsection (8 lines) at end of "Out of scope for this ledger" citing the .2/.3/.4 "no new" confirmation and stamping the epic's verification date.
- docs/PLATFORMS.md — no change
