# CORE-078 | plan-none-placeholder

[← PLAN.md](../PLAN.md) · 🟢 In progress · 🔗 [[CORE-073]]

## 🎯 Goal

Insert `(none)` under the empty `## Medium` heading in `_project/PLAN.md` to match the `templates/PLAN.md` empty-section convention.

## ✅ Acceptance

- [ ] `_project/PLAN.md` `## Medium` section has `(none)` placeholder on the line following the heading (matching template convention)

## 🧩 Subtasks

- [ ] Insert `(none)` under `## Medium` in `_project/PLAN.md`

## 🔗 Related

- [[CORE-073]] — audit-flowtron-self (surfaced this finding)

## 📝 Phase 1: Discovery

- [x] Reviewed the task entry in PLAN.md
- [x] **Relevance Assessment**

  **Verdict:** Proceed
  **Rationale:** `_project/PLAN.md` `## Medium` has no tasks and no `(none)` placeholder. `templates/PLAN.md` uses `(none)` for every empty section (Critical, Medium, Low, Future Opportunities). One-line fix.

- [x] Read relevant source files
- [x] **Archive skim** — grepped archive for `templates/PLAN.md` and `(none)`; no prior tasknotes specifically addressed this placeholder convention. CORE-040 (filing discipline) touched `_project/PLAN.md` but not the empty-section `(none)` pattern.
- [x] **Drift check** — `_project/PLAN.md` line 22 is `## Medium` followed by a blank line then `## Low`. Fix is still valid.
- [x] Asked clarifying questions OR logged "No clarifications needed" with explicit assumptions — No clarifications needed. Single cosmetic insertion to match template.
- [x] Subtasks above populated with concrete, ordered steps

**Discovery Notes:**

`_project/PLAN.md` currently: `## Medium\n\n## Low`. Template has `(none)` after every empty section heading. One-line edit to insert `(none)` after the blank line following `## Medium`.

## 🛠️ Phase 2: Execution

- [x] **Pattern survey** — `templates/PLAN.md` is the authoritative shape; `## Medium` already has `(none)` there. Extending that pattern to `_project/PLAN.md`.
- [x] Implemented the minimal solution
- [x] Updated/added tests for non-trivial behavior — N/A (doc-only edit)

**Implementation Notes:**

Inserted `(none)` under `## Medium` in `_project/PLAN.md` (one line). No other files touched.

## 🧪 Phase 3: Testing & Linting

- [x] Ran targeted test suite for changed code — N/A (doc-only)
- [x] Ran lint/type-check on changed code — N/A (doc-only)
- [x] (frontend) Asked the user for visual confirmation (👁️ prefix on the prose ask) — N/A

**Testing Notes:**

Doc-only change; no test or lint surface.

## 🚀 Phase 4: Closure

- [x] **Doc-drift sweep** — `README.md`: no change · `SPEC.md`: no change · `docs/MIGRATION.md`: no change · `claude/CLAUDE-snippet.md`: no change
- [x] Closed — PLAN.md line flipped to stub form and tasknote moved to archive
- [x] Recap drafted (surfaces at the 📦 ready-to-commit gate)

**Final Summary:**

Inserted `(none)` under the empty `## Medium` heading in `_project/PLAN.md` (1-line edit) to match the `templates/PLAN.md` empty-section convention.
