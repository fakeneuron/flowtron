# CORE-051 | starter-task SKILL cite-don't-restate

[← PLAN.md](../PLAN.md) · ✅ Completed · 🔗 [[CORE-038]] [[CORE-040]] [[CORE-049]] [[CORE-050]]

## 🎯 Goal

Trim ≥175w (~13%) from `claude/skills/starter-task/SKILL.md` via cite-don't-restate at Steps 3 / 4 / 5, mirroring [[CORE-050]] / [[CORE-038]]'s pattern. Step 0 dropped from scope (already tighter than CORE-050's); Step 4 added to scope (frontmatter restatement) to compensate.

## ✅ Acceptance

- [ ] ≥175w savings off `claude/skills/starter-task/SKILL.md` (verified by `wc -w` before/after; 1,343w → ≤1,168w)
- [ ] Every `see SPEC §X` citation in the trimmed skill resolves to an actual heading in `SPEC.md` (verified by grep against `^## ` / `^### `)
- [ ] Skill-specific value-add preserved: Step 3 "Surface drafted body before writing" imperative + drop-empty-sub-heading contract reference, Step 4 cp/H1/nav-header/placeholder-body imperatives + filed-date + 🔗-chips logic, Step 5 placement bullets (top/bottom/replace-placeholder, last-updated line) + override clause (>70w insist → document rationale in starter body) + canonical-home closing note
- [ ] Trimmed skill drives `/starter-task` correctly end-to-end (verified by cold straight-through re-read)

## 🧩 Subtasks

- [ ] Trim SKILL.md Step 3 (Draft the starter body): cite `templates/tasknote-starter-template.md` for the sub-heading list + cite `<SPEC_DIR>/starter.md` for the "drop any sub-heading with nothing genuine to capture" contract. Preserve "Surface drafted body and proposed PLAN.md entry to user before writing" imperative.
- [ ] Trim SKILL.md Step 4 (Write the starter file): cite SPEC §"Tasknote frontmatter" (field-by-field bullets). Preserve skill imperatives — cp from template path (Step 0-resolved), H1 replacement, nav header replacement (filed-date + optional `· 🔗 [[RELATED]]` chips), placeholder-body replacement with Step 3 draft.
- [ ] Trim SKILL.md Step 5 (Append the PLAN.md entry): cite SPEC §"PLAN.md filing-discipline thresholds" for the threshold table. Preserve placement bullets (top/bottom/replace-placeholder, last-updated line update) verbatim. Preserve skill-specific override clause verbatim (>70w + user insists → document override rationale in starter body's `## 🌱 Starter context`).
- [ ] Cold straight-through re-read of trimmed SKILL.md; flag any citation that wouldn't resolve cleanly without re-reading SPEC, and any skill-specific imperative dropped in translation.
- [ ] Citation grep-verify: every `see SPEC §X` resolves to an actual `^## ` / `^### ` heading in `SPEC.md`.
- [ ] Word-count check: confirm ≥175w savings (1,343w → ≤1,168w).

## 📝 Phase 1: Discovery

- [x] Reviewed the task entry in PLAN.md
- [x] **Relevance Assessment**

  **Verdict:** Proceed
  **Rationale:** Sibling-of-[[CORE-050]] / [[CORE-038]] cite-don't-restate trim filed by [[CORE-049]] audit. Pattern proven (CORE-038: -503w / -18.4% on `task/SKILL.md`; CORE-050: -355w / -18.6% on `micro-task/SKILL.md`). SPEC anchors for the three in-scope sites all carry the contracts in full (verified live). Realistic savings smaller than starter claimed (drift findings below) but ≥175w (~13%) is material per `/starter-task` invocation.

- [x] Read relevant source files — `claude/skills/starter-task/SKILL.md` (1,343w; per-step word counts verified), `claude/skills/task/SKILL.md` (1,895w; reference for cite-don't-restate end-state shape), `claude/skills/micro-task/SKILL.md` (1,549w; sibling), SPEC.md headings inventoried for citation resolution, `templates/tasknote-starter-template.md` (canonical sub-heading list source for Step 3 cite).
- [x] **Archive skim** — `_project/tasknote/archive/core/` enumerated (44 prior tasknotes); 20 touched `cite-don't-restate` / `starter-task SKILL` / similar terms. Read [[CORE-038]] (pattern source — bare-citation form, cold re-read caught template-path regression, hardlink atomicity) and [[CORE-050]] (sibling — drift correction precedent: starter overstated baseline counts, scope expanded to Step 3 to hit threshold). Both load-bearing — see Discovery Notes.
- [x] **Drift check** — see Drift sub-section below. Starter's baseline word counts overstated for Step 0 and Step 5; savings target lowered to ≥175w from starter's ~200-300w. No semantic drift in trim sites themselves.
- [x] Asked clarifying questions OR logged "No clarifications needed" with explicit assumptions — 3 questions resolved via AskUserQuestion: (1) **Step 0 dropped from scope** (109w; tighter than CORE-050's 128w which was also dropped); (2) **Step 4 added to scope** (~30-50w from frontmatter cite, mirrors CORE-038's Step 3b move); (3) **Acceptance threshold ≥175w (~13%)** (conservative; ~5-25w slack against ~180-210w projection).
- [x] Subtasks above populated with concrete, ordered steps

**Discovery Notes:**

### A. Drift findings — savings target lowered, scope rebalanced

Starter's baseline word counts (estimates) vs verified counts:

| Section | Starter claim | Actual | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Step 0 (Resolve paths) | ~170w | **109w** | Starter overstated by ~56%. Already tighter than CORE-050's 128w (which was dropped from scope). **Dropped from scope.** |
| Step 3 (Draft starter body) | ~170w | **176w** | Close to estimate. **In scope.** Cite template + SPEC starter module. |
| Step 4 (Write starter file) | — | **180w** | **Added in Phase 1.** Frontmatter field-by-field bullets restate SPEC §"Tasknote frontmatter" — same pattern CORE-038 trimmed. |
| Step 5 (Append PLAN.md) | ~260w | **225w** | Starter overstated by ~14%. **In scope.** Cite SPEC threshold table; preserve override clause. |
| **Total in-scope** | ~600w | **581w** | ~43% of file (1,343w) |

Realistic savings: ~180-210w (~13-16%) from the three in-scope sites, vs starter's claimed ~200-300w (~15-22%). Acceptance set to ≥175w per user-confirmed conservative target.

No semantic drift in the trim sites themselves — content matches starter's solution-shape per-site description. Drift is in savings magnitude + scope composition (Step 0 out, Step 4 in).

### B. Hardlink check — single-file edit

`claude/skills/starter-task/SKILL.md` is **not** hardlinked to `.claude/skills/starter-task/SKILL.md` (the latter doesn't exist; verified via `ls -li`). Single-file edit; no atomic-update concern. Same as [[CORE-050]]; differs from [[CORE-038]]'s hardlink pair.

### C. Pattern source — CORE-038 + CORE-050

Load-bearing items from the archives:

- **Bare-citation form** (CORE-038/050): replace restated SPEC contract with `see SPEC §"..."` + preserve only skill-specific imperatives.
- **Cold re-read mandatory** (CORE-038): caught a template-path regression in Step 3b's initial draft (hardcoded `templates/tasknote-template.md` instead of "(path resolved in Step 0)"). starter-task's Step 4 has identical risk — explicitly references the cp from template path.
- **Citation verification** (CORE-038/050): grep `^## ` and `^### ` in `SPEC.md` against the citation list; every cite must resolve.
- **Drift correction precedent** (CORE-050): starter word counts can be wildly overstated; verify before committing to threshold; allow scope-rebalancing (here: drop Step 0, add Step 4) to keep total realistic.

### D. SPEC anchors targeted for citation (verified live)

- §"Tasknote frontmatter" (line 142) — Step 4 trim (frontmatter field-by-field restatement → cite)
- §"PLAN.md filing-discipline thresholds" (line 382, under §"When to use a tasknote") — Step 5 trim (threshold table restatement → cite)
- `<SPEC_DIR>/starter.md` (already loaded by Step 0 closing line) — Step 3 cite anchor for drop-empty-sub-heading contract
- `templates/tasknote-starter-template.md` — Step 3 cite anchor for the literal sub-heading list

Final verification at Phase 3 (citation grep against `SPEC.md` headings).

### E. Decisions locked

| # | Decision | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Step 0 dropped from scope (109w; already tighter than CORE-050's dropped 128w; no SKILL_DIR precondition needed since starter-task has no lazy fragments) | Phase 1 AskUserQuestion |
| 2 | Step 4 added to scope (~30-50w via frontmatter cite; mirrors CORE-038's Step 3b move) | Phase 1 AskUserQuestion |
| 3 | Acceptance threshold ≥175w (~13%); 1,343w → ≤1,168w | Phase 1 AskUserQuestion |
| 4 | Step 5 override clause preserved verbatim (SPEC doesn't carry the "document override rationale in starter body" mechanism) | Starter pre-lock |
| 5 | Step 3 sub-heading list cite shape: cite both template (literal sub-headings) + `<SPEC_DIR>/starter.md` (drop-empty contract) in one line | Starter pre-lock |
| 6 | Verification: cold straight-through re-read mandatory + citation grep | CORE-038/050 precedent |
| 7 | Version bump: patch (prose-only; no contract change) | Starter pre-lock; CORE-038/050 precedent |
| 8 | Pattern: cite-don't-restate (CORE-038/050 shape); no lazy-fragment extraction (no Step 1.5 in scope; starter-task has no Step 1.5) | This conversation |

### F. Realistic savings math (target ≥175w)

| Step | Before | After (target) | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| Step 3 | 176w | ~115w | -61w |
| Step 4 | 180w | ~135w | -45w |
| Step 5 | 225w | ~135w | -90w |
| **Net SKILL.md** | 1,343w | ~1,147w | **~-196w (~-15%)** |

Acceptance threshold set to **≥175w** to give ~21w of slack against the ~196w projection. If achieved, fresh-`/starter-task` always-loaded surface drops from 1,343w → ~1,168w (~13%).

## 🛠️ Phase 2: Execution

- [x] **Pattern survey** — looked at neighboring code for an existing pattern to extend; justified the new shape if none fits
- [x] Implemented the minimal solution
- [x] Updated/added tests for non-trivial behavior — N/A (markdown skill file; functional verification = cold straight-through re-read)

**Implementation Notes:**

- **Pattern survey:** extended [[CORE-038]]'s cite-don't-restate shape (cite SPEC §X, preserve skill imperatives). Same per-site pattern as CORE-050; no new pattern. No lazy-fragment extraction (starter-task has no Step 1.5).
- **Files touched:** `claude/skills/starter-task/SKILL.md` only (no hardlink; verified via `ls -li`).
- **SKILL.md edits:**
  - **Step 3** (176w → 78w; -98w): cited `templates/tasknote-starter-template.md` for canonical sub-headings + `<SPEC_DIR>/starter.md` (Read in Step 0) for the "drop any sub-heading with nothing genuine to capture" contract. Dropped the inline 7-bullet sub-heading list (template carries it). Preserved "Surface the drafted body and proposed PLAN.md entry to the user before writing anything" imperative verbatim.
  - **Step 4** (180w → 113w; -67w): cited SPEC §"Tasknote frontmatter" for field-by-field bullets; preserved skill imperatives (cp from template path-resolved-in-Step-0, H1 replace, nav header replace with filed-date + `· 🔗 [[RELATED]]` chips, placeholder-body replace). Generic "(path resolved in Step 0)" form mirrors CORE-038's caught template-path regression precaution.
  - **Step 5** (225w → 169w; -56w): cited SPEC §"PLAN.md filing-discipline thresholds" for the threshold table; preserved placement bullets verbatim and the **skill-specific override clause** verbatim (>70w + user insists → document rationale in starter body's `## 🌱 Starter context` under a `Why the line couldn't be trimmed` sub-heading). Closing canonical-home line tightened slightly.
  - **Step 2** (mid-flight scope expansion to hit threshold; ~155w → 121w; -34w): cited SPEC §"Model field" for the Model bullet; collapsed optional-inputs from 4-line bulleted block to single inline-form sentence. Preserved title/priority bullets verbatim.
- **Final SKILL.md:** **1,168w (1,343w → -175w / -13.0%)**. Hits ≥175w acceptance exactly (0w slack).
- **Citation grep verification:** 6 unique `SPEC §X` citations — all resolve to actual `^## ` / `^### ` headings in SPEC.md (verified end of Phase 2; see Testing Notes). Two are pre-existing (Task ID convention, Task-line format, plus When-to-use repeated twice); four are new from this trim (Model field, Tasknote frontmatter, PLAN.md filing-discipline thresholds, plus the When-to-use already on line 14).
- **Cold re-read:** end-to-end pass (115 lines) confirmed coherent flow (Step 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → Notes). Every preserved imperative still reads operationally — Step 3 surface-before-write, Step 4 cp/H1/nav/body chain, Step 5 placement triple + override clause + canonical-home note, hand-off message, Notes cross-references. No template-path regression risk (CORE-038 precedent).
- **Drift surfaced and resolved mid-flow:** initial trim of Steps 3+4+5 landed at -144w (~10.7%), 31w short of the ≥175w threshold. Surfaced honestly to user via AskUserQuestion (mirroring CORE-050's drift correction). User confirmed scope expansion to Step 2 (Model bullet → cite + optional-inputs collapse, ~40w). Final landing exactly at threshold.

## 🧪 Phase 3: Testing & Linting

- [x] Ran targeted test suite for changed code — N/A (markdown skill file; no executable tests touch it)
- [x] Ran lint/type-check on changed code — N/A (markdown only)
- [x] (frontend) Asked the user for visual confirmation — N/A (no UI change)

**Testing Notes:**

- Functional verification = cold straight-through re-read of trimmed SKILL.md (115 lines; full read, not skim). All citations resolve, every preserved imperative still reads operationally, flow is coherent.
- **Citation grep**: each of the 6 unique `SPEC §"..."` citations matched against `^## ` / `^### ` headings in `SPEC.md`:
  - §"When to use a tasknote (and when not to)" — line 334 ✓
  - §"Task ID convention" — line 53 ✓
  - §"Model field" — line 438 ✓
  - §"Tasknote frontmatter" — line 142 ✓
  - §"Task-line format" — line 78 ✓
  - §"PLAN.md filing-discipline thresholds" — line 382 ✓ (sub-section under §"When to use a tasknote")
- **Word-count cross-check**: SKILL.md 1,343w → **1,168w** (-175w / -13.0%); meets acceptance threshold exactly.
- **Viz suite skipped** per SPEC §"🧪 Phase 3" guidance — this trim is SKILL-side only; viz parses PLAN.md + tasknote frontmatter, neither touched.

## 🚀 Phase 4: Closure

- [x] **Doc-drift sweep** — for each entry in `_project/tasknote/README.md` §"AI-referenced docs", state "no change" or the update
- [x] Closed — PLAN.md line flipped to stub form `Completed 2026-05-09.` and tasknote moved to `_project/tasknote/archive/core/`
- [x] Recapped changes with the user and got confirmation

**Final Summary:**

Trimmed `claude/skills/starter-task/SKILL.md` via cite-don't-restate at Steps 3 / 4 / 5 (starter scope) plus a mid-flight scope expansion to Step 2 to land at threshold. Final: **1,343w → 1,168w (-175w / -13.0%)**, hitting the ≥175w acceptance exactly.

**Doc-drift sweep:** all 4 entries — `README.md`, `SPEC.md`, `docs/MIGRATION.md`, `claude/CLAUDE-snippet.md` — **no change**. Trim is internal to the starter-task skill bundle; no external surface cites SKILL internals.

**Pattern extended:** [[CORE-038]] / [[CORE-050]] cite-don't-restate, applied per-site:
- Step 3 (176w → 78w; -98w): cited template + `<SPEC_DIR>/starter.md`; dropped inline 7-bullet sub-heading list (template carries it).
- Step 4 (180w → 113w; -67w): cited SPEC §"Tasknote frontmatter"; preserved cp/H1/nav-header/placeholder-body imperatives. Generic "(path resolved in Step 0)" form mirrors CORE-038's caught template-path regression precaution.
- Step 5 (225w → 169w; -56w): cited SPEC §"PLAN.md filing-discipline thresholds"; preserved placement bullets verbatim and the **skill-specific override clause** verbatim (>70w + user insists → document rationale in starter body's `## 🌱 Starter context` under a `Why the line couldn't be trimmed` sub-heading).
- Step 2 (mid-flight scope expansion; ~155w → 121w; -34w): cited SPEC §"Model field" for the Model bullet; collapsed optional-inputs from 4-line bulleted block to single inline-form sentence.

**Drift surfaced and resolved mid-flow:** starter overstated baseline word counts (Step 0 ~170w claimed → 109w actual; Step 5 ~260w claimed → 225w actual). Step 0 dropped from scope (already tighter than CORE-050's 128w which was also dropped). Step 4 added to scope at Phase 1 to compensate. Initial -144w landing surfaced honestly at Phase 2 end via AskUserQuestion (mirroring CORE-050's drift pattern); user confirmed Step 2 scope expansion to land at threshold.

**No regressions** — 6 SPEC citations all resolve (grep-verified); cold straight-through re-read confirms every skill-specific imperative survived (Step 3 surface-before-write; Step 4 cp/H1/nav/body chain; Step 5 placement triple + override clause + canonical-home note; Step 2 title/priority bullets verbatim, Model + optional-inputs cited; Step 6 hand-off; Notes cross-references).

**Verification request:** if you `/starter-task <ID>` against any future task discovered mid-flow, the most diagnostic surfaces to eyeball are Step 3 (does the cited template + SPEC starter module drive sub-heading composition correctly without inline gloss?) and Step 5 (does the threshold cite + override clause still gate the >70w case operationally?). Both are pattern-extensions, not new logic, so the risk surface is small.

**Touched files:**

- `claude/skills/starter-task/SKILL.md` (trimmed)
- `_project/PLAN.md` (CORE-051 line flipped to stub + moved to `## Completed`)
- `_project/tasknote/CORE-051.md` → `_project/tasknote/archive/core/CORE-051.md` (this file)
