# Layout, and working in the flowtron repo itself

> Lazy-loaded SPEC module. Read when adopting flowtron into a project, working **on** flowtron rather than with it, wiring skills into a platform, or naming a skill. Not needed to run a task. See `SPEC.md` for the always-loaded core spec.

## Layout in adopting projects

After adopting flowtron, a project looks like:

```text
<project>/
├── AGENTS.md                       # references .flowtron/core/SPEC.md
├── .flowtron/
│   ├── PLAN.md                     # project-owned roadmap (this format)
│   ├── tasknote/
│   │   ├── README.md               # one-line pointer + project-specific notes
│   │   ├── BE-014.md               # active tasknotes
│   │   └── archive/<area>/         # completed tasknotes by area
│   ├── specs/                      # optional; hand-copied spec-template.md drafts
│   ├── sidequest/                  # optional; /ft-file-followup --park stubs
│   ├── STATS.md                    # optional; /ft-stats --write regeneratable
│   └── core/                       # git submodule pinned to a flowtron version
└── ...
```

The `.flowtron/core/` submodule is **read-only** in adopting projects.
Edits go upstream to the flowtron repo and are pulled via deliberate version
bumps (see [`SPEC.md`](../SPEC.md) §"Versioning").

## Working in the flowtron repo itself

Flowtron does not submodule itself. When working in `~/code/flowtron/`:

- The repo-root `SPEC.md` IS the canonical reference.
- `SPEC/` — lazy SPEC modules loaded on demand by skills.
- `SPEC/procedures/` — agent-neutral procedure SOPs: the source-of-truth projection of execution procedures (e.g. the `/ft-task` 4-phase workflow) for non-Claude wiring and contract-only agents. Format + loading convention: [`SPEC/procedures/README.md`](procedures/README.md).
- The flowtron `.flowtron/PLAN.md` tracks flowtron's own development.
- The `templates/` folder holds the canonical tasknote templates (full, micro, starter, sidequest) plus spec, loop-heartbeat, audit-overlay (usage: [`docs/MIGRATION.md`](../docs/MIGRATION.md) §1.2.1), and subagent-probe templates, and the `PLAN.md` / `tasknote-README.md` seed files.
- `claude/` — Claude Code commands + skills (`/ft-task`, `/ft-release`, `/ft-new-project`, ...); the adopter snippet lives at `claude/AGENTS-snippet.md`.
- `codex/` — Codex skill wrappers for the full `ft-*` inventory plus Codex-specific wiring notes.
- `cursor/` — Cursor thin wiring (`AGENTS-snippet.md` + `procedures/ft-task.md` pointer; no skill wrappers — adopters wire canonical `claude/skills/` bodies).
- `grok/` — Grok thin wiring (`AGENTS-snippet.md` + `procedures/ft-task.md` pointer; no skill wrappers — adopters wire canonical `claude/skills/` bodies).
- `tools/` — operator-side fleet scripts. Currently `update-adopters.mjs`, the singular CLI carve-out documented in [`SPEC/scope-boundaries.md`](scope-boundaries.md), plus its portable `update-adopters.test.mjs` suite (a registered release gate).

Global-only utilities install per [`docs/MIGRATION.md`](../docs/MIGRATION.md) §1.0. `/ft-release` is flowtron-self-only and stays repo-scoped in this checkout ([`docs/PLATFORMS.md`](../docs/PLATFORMS.md) §"Installed-surface policy").

### Lazy SPEC module frontmatter

Each `SPEC/*.md` lazy module opens with optional YAML frontmatter
carrying a `paths:` field — an array of bash-style globs naming the
tasknote-filename shapes the module applies to:

```yaml
---
paths: ['*-EPIC-*.md', '*.[0-9]*.md']
---
```

The field is **populated only where a filename-based trigger applies**.
`SPEC/epic.md` declares the parent-epic and epic-subtask filename shapes;
the remaining modules (`starter` · `blocked` · `model` · `versioning` ·
`gates` · `cue-vocabulary` · `gate-discipline` · `tasknote-selection` ·
`loop` · `plan-parser` · `layout` ·
`scope-boundaries` · `tasknote-inserts` · `purpose-blurb` ·
`superseded-claims`) have status- or content-based triggers
and declare `paths: []`. The
leading `> Lazy-loaded SPEC module. Loaded by ...` prose line stays
authoritative for status/content triggers.

The contract is **declarative today**: the source of truth for which
module loads when is still `claude/skills/ft-task/SKILL.md`'s explicit
dispatch (Steps 0 / 1.5 / 2 / 3a / 3c / 5 — Step 0's `--loop` branch is the
dispatch source for `SPEC/loop.md`). Future tooling MAY parse the
frontmatter to drive dispatch dynamically.

### Procedure SOPs (`SPEC/procedures/`)

`SPEC/procedures/*.md` files are a distinct artifact from the lazy SPEC
modules above: agent-neutral **procedure SOPs** that project an execution
procedure (e.g. the `/ft-task` 4-phase workflow) for contract-only agents.
They carry a different frontmatter shape — `procedure:` / `source:` /
`restates:` / `last-verified:`, not `paths:` — and are loaded by thin per-agent pointer
wrappers (`<platform>/procedures/<procedure>.md`) rather than by the
`/ft-task` SKILL dispatch. Canonical schema + loading convention:
[`SPEC/procedures/README.md`](procedures/README.md).

## Skill namespace

Bundled flowtron skills carry the `ft-` prefix in their slug (`/ft-task`,
`/ft-release`, `/ft-new-project`,
`/ft-micro-task`, `/ft-file-followup`, `/ft-epic-discovery`,
`/ft-close-epic`, `/ft-refactor`,
`/ft-flowtron`, `/ft-stats`,
`/ft-audit-context`, `/ft-update`, and the audit family
`/ft-audit{,-repo}`). The prefix
reserves the `ft-` slug namespace for flowtron-owned skills so adopter
projects can drop the bundle into `.claude/` without shadowing their own
skill names.

**Adopters MUST NOT use `ft-` for project-specific skills.** Reserve the
prefix for upstream flowtron. When forking the audit family per
[`docs/MIGRATION.md`](../docs/MIGRATION.md) §1.2.1, name the fork **without**
the prefix (e.g., `audit-payments`, not `ft-audit-payments`) — the fork is
adopter-owned and the unprefixed name makes ownership clear in skill
resolution.

**Wrapper-name invariant (grep-able).** Every command wrapper
`claude/commands/<name>.md` names its own basename in its invoke sentence
(`` Invoke the `<name>` skill ``) — skill resolution must never depend on
the model inferring a prefixed name from an unprefixed one. Check (prints
nothing when clean):

```sh
for f in claude/commands/ft-*.md; do
  grep -q "\`$(basename "$f" .md)\`" "$f" || echo "$f"
done
```
