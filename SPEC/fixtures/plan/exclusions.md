# Fixture — exclusions and diagnostics

Lines that must not become tasks: some are silently excluded (bare checkbox
bullets, HTML comments, fenced code, completed legacy label lines, rows
outside a recognized section), others surface as `unparsed` diagnostics
(malformed IDs, malformed tokens, pending legacy-shaped rows). Also the
near-miss heading diagnostic.
