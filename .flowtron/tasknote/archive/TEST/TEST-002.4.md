# TEST-002.4 | gate discoverability

[← PLAN.md](../PLAN.md) · 🟢 In progress · 🔗 [[TEST-EPIC-002]] [[CORE-360]] [[CORE-280]]

## 🎯 Goal

Make the portable updater verification suite discoverable from project entry points and a required Flowtron release gate.

## ✅ Acceptance

- [x] `AGENTS.md` names the updater suite and its syntax check as root-level validation commands
- [x] `.flowtron/tasknote/README.md` lists the updater suite in Project quick commands
- [x] `/ft-release` runs the updater suite with the visualizer release gates
- [x] The documented updater test and syntax-check commands pass

## 🧩 Subtasks

- [x] Add the updater validation commands to `AGENTS.md`
- [x] Add the updater suite to Project quick commands with its release-gate role
- [x] Extend the release Phase 3 command block and prose with the updater suite
- [x] Run the updater suite and syntax checks; review documentation formatting
- [x] Complete the documentation sweep and archive the child atomically with its documentation deliverable

## 📝 Phase 1: Discovery

- [x] Reviewed the task entry in PLAN.md

- [x] **Relevance Assessment**

  **Verdict:** Proceed
  **Rationale:** The updater suite is now portable and green but absent from both root-level command discovery and the release verification block, leaving the epic's verification baseline incomplete.

- [x] Read relevant source files — `AGENTS.md`, `.flowtron/tasknote/README.md`, `claude/skills/ft-release/SKILL.md`, `tools/update-adopters.test.mjs`, and the active epic cohort in `.flowtron/PLAN.md`

- [x] **Best Practices Review** — documentation/workflow wiring only: `AGENTS.md` owns root validation guidance, tasknote README owns project quick commands, and `ft-release` owns release gates. Extend their established command-list patterns; no abstraction, production-code change, or refactor is needed.

- [x] **Archive skim** — `CORE-360` introduced the zero-dependency 21-test updater suite and requires `node --test` plus syntax checks; `TEST-002.3` made its two local-clone fixture layers portable in restricted sandboxes; `CORE-280` is the direct release-gate precedent, adding visualizer tests alongside lint and typecheck. These establish the exact command and gate shape.

- [x] **Drift check** — the cited updater suite exists at `tools/update-adopters.test.mjs`, uses `node:test`, and currently contains 21 tests. `AGENTS.md` only lists visualizer validation, Project quick commands only list visualizer commands, and `/ft-release` Step 6 runs visualizer lint/typecheck/test only. The filed gap is current.

- [x] Asked clarifying questions OR logged "No clarifications needed" with explicit assumptions — No clarifications needed. Assume the complete portable updater suite is the release gate, with `node --check` retained as its adjacent lightweight syntax validation; no live fleet dry-run or `--apply` operation belongs in release verification.

- [x] Subtasks above populated with concrete, ordered steps

**Discovery Notes:**

The three requested surfaces map cleanly to existing responsibilities. The release command block is the only policy-bearing source; entry-point documentation should name the same runnable commands without duplicating implementation detail. Discovery surfaced no significant deviation → skip 🛠️.

## 🛠️ Phase 2: Execution

- [x] **Pattern survey** — followed `CORE-280`'s established release-gate command block, `AGENTS.md`'s root-validation section, and Project quick commands; each source now names the updater suite at its own responsibility boundary without creating a parallel command surface

- [x] **Minimal refactor gate** — no refactor needed; this is additive command and policy documentation. Consolidating visualizer and updater commands behind a new wrapper would broaden the zero-dependency tools surface without improving the release boundary.

- [x] Implemented the minimal solution

- [x] Updated/added tests for non-trivial behavior — N/A (documentation and release-workflow wiring only; the existing 21-test updater suite is the behavior being registered)

**Implementation Notes:**

Added the updater `node --test` suite and both `node --check` commands to root agent validation, registered the suite and its release-gate role in Project quick commands, and added the suite to `/ft-release` Step 6 after the visualizer lint/typecheck/test gate. The release prose now explicitly identifies both gate groups; no updater implementation or release automation changed.

## 🧪 Phase 3: Testing & Linting

- [x] Ran targeted test suite for changed code — `node --test tools/update-adopters.test.mjs`: 21 tests across 8 suites passed; 0 failed, cancelled, or skipped

- [x] Ran lint/type-check on changed code — `node --check tools/update-adopters.test.mjs` and `node --check tools/update-adopters.mjs`: clean; `git diff --check`: clean

- [x] **Quality assertions** — the documentation-only diff keeps command ownership distinct: root-agent guidance, quick-command discovery, and release enforcement. It adds no runtime code, public CLI surface, duplication, or stale policy language.

- [x] (frontend) Asked the user for visual confirmation (👁️ prefix on the prose ask) — N/A (no frontend or rendered UI behavior changed)

**Testing Notes:**

The restricted sandbox completed the portable updater fixtures in 59.5 seconds. The test output reports 21 passes across 8 suites and no failures, cancellations, skips, or todos. Syntax checks and the final documentation diff are clean.

## 🚀 Phase 4: Closure

- [x] **Doc-drift sweep** — the updater command and release-gate documentation change does not alter the declared AI cold-start contract or adopter wiring:

  - `README.md` — no change
  - `SPEC.md` — no change
  - `docs/MIGRATION.md` — no change
  - `claude/AGENTS-snippet.md` — no change
  - `codex/AGENTS-snippet.md` — no change
  - `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` — no change
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` — no change
  - `SECURITY.md` — no change
  - `docs/AGENT-NEUTRALITY.md` — no change
  - `docs/PLATFORMS.md` — no change
  - `claude/CAPABILITIES.md` — no change; its v5.13.0 verification stamp remains current
  - `docs/AGENT-COMPAT.md` — no change

- [x] Closed — PLAN.md line flipped to stub form `Completed 2026-07-23.` and kept nested beneath active parent `TEST-EPIC-002`, then tasknote moved to `.flowtron/tasknote/archive/TEST/`

- [x] **Evidence-based recap** drafted — changed files/LOC where meaningful, verification commands/results, refactors made or deferred with rationale, documentation verdict, and concrete maintainability effect (surfaces at the 📦 ready-to-commit gate, or inline on conditional skip)

**Final Summary:**

Registered the portable updater suite in the root agent guide, Project quick commands, and `/ft-release` Step 6, making its 21 behavior checks both discoverable and release-required. The implementation changes three documentation/workflow surfaces plus closure metadata; the full updater suite passed 21/21, both updater files passed `node --check`, and `git diff --check` was clean. No refactor or runtime change was needed, all 12 AI-referenced docs remain current, and releases can no longer omit the updater safety net by default.
