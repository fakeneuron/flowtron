# CORE-415.4 | viz-glyph-tolerance

[← PLAN.md](../PLAN.md) · 🟢 In progress · 🔗 [[CORE-EPIC-415]]

## 🎯 Goal

Verify whether `CORE-415.2`/`.3`'s emoji-contract changes touched any glyph or shape parsed by `viz/src/parser.ts`, and close as a verification pass if not — per the PLAN line's conditional.

## ⚡ Notes

**Relevance:** Proceed — the conditional's premise ("if nothing viz-parsed changed") needs an independent check against current code, not just inherited from `.2`/`.3`'s notes.
**Best Practices Review:** N/A — no code change anticipated; if the premise holds, this is a verification-only task with no module boundary to assess.
**Drift check:** No drift. `viz/src/parser.ts` still parses exactly two glyph sets: `STATUS_GLYPH` = `🟢|⏸|✅|⚪|🌱` (line 66) and `SUGGESTION_GLYPH` = `🧠|🔧|🧩` (line 71). `git log --name-only` for the `CORE-415.1`/`.2`/`.3` commits (815e56a, 3ee4e6a, 8a27d0d) shows zero files under `viz/` touched — confirmed directly, not just cited from `.2`/`.3`'s Discovery/Testing notes. The plan does not contradict any SPEC contract.
**Archive skim:** `CORE-415.2` (Discovery Notes + Testing Notes) and `CORE-415.3` (Testing Notes, Invariant 4) both independently resolved this task's premise from evidence: neither glyph set was touched, so `.4` was expected to close as a verification pass. `CORE-353.6` (`viz-parser-glyph-tolerance`) is the precedent for what an actual tolerance *change* looks like here (extending the `SUGGESTION_GLYPH` regex + a parser regression test) — not needed this time since no glyph moved.
**Pattern survey:** N/A — no new code shape introduced; this task only re-confirms an existing parser contract is undisturbed.
**Implementation:** No code changes. Independently re-verified the premise `.2`/`.3` recorded: grepped `viz/src/parser.ts` for `STATUS_GLYPH`/`SUGGESTION_GLYPH` (unchanged glyph sets) and cross-checked `git log --name-only` across all three prior epic-child commits — no `viz/` file appears in any of them. Ran the full `viz` test suite as a regression check: **18 files / 245 tests passed** (9.6s). Closes as a verification pass exactly as the PLAN line's conditional anticipated.
**Docs touched:** No change — no doc entry in `.flowtron/tasknote/README.md` §"AI-referenced docs" describes `viz` parser glyph tolerances outside `SPEC.md` §"Parser tolerances (decorative, not captured)", which itself is unaffected since no glyph set changed.

## ✅ Recap

Verified — independently, not by trusting `.2`/`.3`'s notes alone — that no glyph or shape parsed by `viz/src/parser.ts` (`STATUS_GLYPH`, `SUGGESTION_GLYPH`) was touched across the `CORE-415.1`–`.3` commits: `git log --name-only` shows zero `viz/` files in any of the three commits, and the parser's glyph regexes are byte-identical to pre-epic. Closes as a verification pass per the PLAN line's conditional; no code or doc changes needed. `viz` suite green (18 files / 245 tests) as a regression confirmation.
