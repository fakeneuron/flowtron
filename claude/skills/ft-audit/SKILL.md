# audit — flowtron parameterized audit skill

Principal-engineer audit of a project surface: find what matters, report concisely, **make no changes without explicit confirmation**.

One dispatcher, eight domains. The shared procedure lives in this file; each domain's pass definitions, severity guide, scope/rubric/gate hints, and specialist rules live in a sibling `passes/<domain>.md` file, loaded at §1 step 1. A second sibling, `scaffold-bootstrap.md`, holds the unfilled-scaffold repair procedure and is loaded only when §1 step 3 trips.

Domain scope: `general` (default — no domain named) · `backend` (audit/review/harden backend/API/server code) · `frontend` (bundle size, accessibility, render performance) · `security` (vulnerabilities, secrets, auth) · `performance` (latency, profiling, resource usage) · `docs` (documentation accuracy, staleness, cross-doc drift) · `structure` (duplication clusters, coupling, module boundaries, god-files, stray scripts) · `context` (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `.claude/` bloat, paste-block redundancy, `ft-*` namespace conflicts, lean-context drift).

Stack-neutral scaffold — **fork**, don't symlink (per-stack rubrics/commands diverge). Fork the whole directory — `SKILL.md` + `scaffold-bootstrap.md` + `passes/` — into `.claude/skills/audit/`. Install per `docs/MIGRATION.md` §1.2.1.

## 0. Forker checklist (fill in before first run)

Walk this list once per fork. Every fillable placeholder lives in the `passes/<domain>.md` files you keep; this file carries one confirm-only item (§5 step 2).

- [ ] `name:` and `description:` frontmatter — set to your fork's slash-command name and a project-specific blurb.
- [ ] Each kept `passes/<domain>.md` §"Scope & rubric hints" — set the default scope glob, your project's actual rubric paths (root `CLAUDE.md`, ADRs, contract docs, config files where invariants live), and your actual gate commands (lint / type-check / test, or scanner / profiler / doc tooling per domain).
- [ ] Each kept `passes/<domain>.md` §"The 5 passes" — replace generic-placeholder bullets with your stack's concrete examples (library invariants, idioms, specific anti-patterns).
- [ ] Each kept `passes/<domain>.md` §"Severity guide" — name your project's sacred invariants under **Critical** (e.g. paper-mode bypass for trading, schema-corruption risk for migrations, auth-bypass for public services).
- [ ] Each kept `passes/<domain>.md` §"Specialist additions" — append project-specific hard rules (e.g. "paper-mode is sacred", "data integrity > convenience").
- [ ] §5 step 2 — confirm the area-prefix list valid for your `.flowtron/tasknote/README.md` §"Area prefixes".
- [ ] Optional: delete pass files for surfaces your project doesn't have (no frontend → remove `passes/frontend.md`). A domain token whose pass file is missing → stop and ask rather than improvise.

The `scaffold-bootstrap.md` fragment (loaded by §1 step 3) automates the mechanical half of this list — it derives glob, rubric files, and gate commands from your repo's manifests and CI config, and can write a prefilled thin-overlay fork for you. What it cannot derive, and what this checklist still exists for, is the judgment half: your sacred invariants under **Critical**, your stack's concrete pass examples, and any extra hard rules.

Once the checklist is satisfied, delete this §0 block from your fork — leaving it in confuses the auditor's first read on every run.

## 1. Domain, scope & ground rules (do this first, always)

1. **Resolve the domain** from `$ARGUMENTS`: if the first whitespace-separated token is one of `general` · `backend` · `frontend` · `security` · `performance` · `docs` · `structure` · `context`, that token is the domain and the **remaining** tokens are the scope args for step 2. Any other first token (a path, `last-commit`, `staged`, …) → domain `general`, and the **whole** `$ARGUMENTS` string is the scope args. Bare invocation → domain `general`, default scope. Then **Read `passes/<domain>.md`** (sibling `passes/` directory) — it supplies the pass definitions (§2), severity guide (§3), scope/rubric/gate hints (this section), attribution slug (§5), and specialist additions. If the user's prose names a focused concern the invocation didn't (asked to "audit auth" but invoked bare), prefer the matching domain over stretching `general`.
2. **Resolve scope** from the scope args: `all`/empty → the pass file's default scope glob; a path → that path; `last-commit` → files in `HEAD`; `staged` → files in `git diff --cached`; plus any extra scope tokens the pass file declares (e.g. an endpoint/route for `backend`, `ai-referenced` for `docs`). If ambiguous, **stop and ask** via `AskUserQuestion`.
3. **Scaffold-bootstrap check.** Scan the loaded `passes/<domain>.md` for unfilled placeholder slots — any `<…>` angle-bracket span in its §"Scope & rubric hints" block, or any `_(forker: …)_` note anywhere in the file — **less anything a thin overlay's `## Deltas` block already supplies**. Zero hits — the normal case in a filled fork, and in a filled overlay — is a silent no-op: continue to step 4 without mentioning it.

   One or more genuinely-unfilled hits → **stop, Read the sibling `scaffold-bootstrap.md`, and run it** before going further. That fragment owns the detection rationale, the thin-overlay exemption in full, the install-context branch, the auto-derivation table and its destructive-intent denylist, and the three resolution branches; it returns with resolved values or an explicit degraded-run acknowledgement.
4. **Load the project rubric** (audit-against contracts, not generic best practices) — the pass file's rubric slots name what to load.
5. **Run verification gates** so passes don't report toolchain noise — commands per the pass file's gate hints; the pass file says which pass absorbs failures as findings.
6. If anything's unclear, stop and ask. Don't guess intent.

## 2. The passes (in order)

Run the pass file's passes **in its exact order**, however many it declares — five for every domain but `context`, which declares six. **Cap each pass at 5 findings max** unless the pass file sets a tighter cap of its own, which wins. If a pass has more than its effective cap, keep the top **N** by severity — N being that cap, not always 5 — and note the tail count (`+3 more Low omitted`).

## 3. Finding format (use exactly this)

```text
**Finding #[N] – [Critical|High|Medium|Low] – [Pass # / Category]**
- Location: `path/to/file:LINE` (or endpoint / component / function / section name)
- Issue: one sentence
- Why it matters: brief — tie to safety / correctness / maintenance cost
- Recommended fix: concrete suggestion or ≤5-line snippet
- Operator action: tell the agent to … — one imperative sentence an operator can hand to an agent verbatim
```

`Operator action:` is not a restatement of `Recommended fix:`. The fix line says *what* should change; this line says *who executes it and how it is dispatched* — "tell the agent to add `response_model=PaymentOut` to the three handlers in `api/payments.py` and extend `test_payments.py` to assert the envelope". Write it so pasting it into a fresh session is enough to start. A finding that cannot produce one is **disqualified** — see §6 "Every finding names an operator action".

Severity is judged against the pass file's severity guide — authoritative for the domain. Insert any extra finding-format lines the pass file declares (e.g. `performance` adds a `Measured impact:` line).

## 4. Required closing sections (always, in order)

1. **Summary** — health score 1–10 with one-sentence justification + top 3 issues (by severity, not pass order).
2. **Exploratory Insights** — what the findings reveal about how the audited surface evolved. Patterns, not individual issues (e.g. "three endpoints still return raw dicts — suggests the typed-response migration stalled mid-phase").
3. **Proposed tasks for `.flowtron/PLAN.md`** — prioritized, actionable tickets using flowtron's task-line grammar. One ticket per thematic cluster, not per finding. Present them inline in the report so the user can review before anything is written to disk — each line exactly as §5 would write it, including any `[unattended]` the §5 candidacy pass proposes.
4. **Questions for the user** — anything ambiguous that blocks implementation. Use `AskUserQuestion` for these, not prose — the user wants real prompts.

## 5. Write the proposed tasks into `.flowtron/PLAN.md` (required, not optional)

The deliverable is tickets in PLAN.md — a report that gets forgotten isn't useful. **Subroutine invocations skip this entire section** (§6 "Subroutine-safe").

1. **Write-step confirmation.** After §§1–4 are presented and any `AskUserQuestion` blockers are answered, stop and confirm via `AskUserQuestion` before writing anything to disk: the proposed ticket list (drop/combine/split per operator feedback first), any **Proposed inline fixes**, and that `.flowtron/PLAN.md` is about to be updated. The operator's yes **is** commit authorization — there is no separate commit-go ask. Zero findings across all passes → say so explicitly and skip this entire section.

   **`[unattended]` candidacy** (mirror of `SPEC/unattended-candidacy.md` §"Three postures" — Read that module now, at this write step). Run its §"Candidacy predicate" over each proposed ticket line as drafted for §4 item 3 — `[model]`, any `[!critical]`, the description with its attribution suffix, any `Blocked by` clause. Every clause must hold; when one is uncertain the row is not a candidate. A candidate is **proposed, never seeded**: show it in the report and again in the write-step `AskUserQuestion` above with the token in place after `[model]` (SPEC §"Task-line format"; position footgun in `SPEC/plan-parser.md`), and step 3 writes the token only on rows the operator's confirmation keeps — an edit that drops it drops it; a declined row shows no token and says nothing. Rows under the trivial-fix carve-out below are **never evaluated** (written and closed in one motion — nothing to dispatch). This skill accepts neither `--fast` nor `--unattended`, so only the attended branch applies — the `unattended-candidates:` emission line never fires from this surface. Neither the candidacy nor its result adds a cue, banner, or checklist box. Flowtron itself never writes `[unattended]` on its own discretion (`SPEC/task-line-segments.md`). Fork note: a thin overlay reads this body by reference and inherits the pass on its next `/ft-update`; a full-copy fork (`.claude/skills/audit/`) reaches it only when the forker re-reconciles after `/ft-update` Step 4.5's drift warning — until then the fork files as before, proposing nothing.
2. **Filing-commit pre-check.** Run `git status --porcelain -- .flowtron/PLAN.md` **and** `git diff --cached --quiet` **before any write** and record `auto-commit`: no output and exit 0 → `auto-commit = true`; any output, or a non-zero exit → `auto-commit = false` (PLAN.md already carries foreign edits, or the index already holds staged content that step 5's commit would otherwise publish — either way the filing rides along in the surrounding commit instead). Run here, immediately before the write — the confirmation pause can stale a pre-flight reading. Not a gate: nothing stops either way; it only decides whether step 5 below runs. Contract: `SPEC/plan-filing.md` §"Filing commits".
3. **Write tickets** using flowtron's task-line grammar: `- [ ] **<AREA>-<N>** [model] | shortname — long description.` — with `[unattended]` inserted after `[model]` on exactly the rows the step 1 confirmation kept, every other segment verbatim (primary labels `[heavy]🧠` / `[medium]🧩` / `[light]🔧` recommended — never `[xheavy]`, manual-only per `SPEC/model.md`; specifics e.g. `opus` / `sonnet` / `grok` remain valid per SPEC §"Model field"). See §"Task-line format". Pick the next free `<N>` per area prefix (valid prefixes in `.flowtron/tasknote/README.md` §"Area prefixes"; the pass file may name the typical prefixes for its domain). Insert in correct priority section (`## High`/`## Medium`/`## Low` for blocking; `## Future Opportunities` otherwise; add `[!critical]` for urgent rows). Append `Surfaced by <slug> YYYY-MM-DD (Finding #N, <severity>)` to each ticket — `<slug>` is the pass file's attribution slug — so the origin's traceable. Include any extra attribution the pass file requires (e.g. `performance` appends the measured-impact number).
4. **No code changes**, no source edits, no opening files for fixes. Tickets only — actual fixes happen in separate `/ft-task` cycles. One exception: the skip-the-tasknote carve-out below, plus any domain exception the pass file declares (e.g. `security`'s leaked-secret immediate-ask path).

**Trivial-fix carve-out (skip-the-tasknote inline path).** When a finding's fix is small enough to hit the skip-the-tasknote threshold — single-line patch, pure formatting tweak, a doc edit under ~10 lines, or a trivial config edit with no logic impact (per SPEC §"When to use a tasknote (and when not to)") — don't file an intermediate `## Low` ticket that needs its own `/ft-task` cycle. Instead, present it in the report under a distinct **Proposed inline fixes** heading (kept separate from the proposed-ticket list) and, on the **same** write-step confirmation that lands the tickets, apply the edit and record it directly under PLAN.md's `## Completed` as a **self-contained** line:

```text
- [x] **<AREA>-<N>** [light] | shortname — <what changed>. Surfaced by <slug> YYYY-MM-DD (Finding #N, <severity>), fixed inline.
```

Keep the description (there is no tasknote/archive file to be the canonical record — see SPEC/plan-filing.md §"`## Completed` archive convention") and take the next free `<N>` like any ticket. A carve-out row is never a candidate for `[unattended]` — it closes in the same write, so the step 1 candidacy pass skips it. Anything above the skip threshold — multi-file, logic impact, or a design tradeoff worth recording — files a normal ticket; never apply a non-trivial fix under this carve-out. The single write-step confirmation covers both tickets and inline fixes; no separate gate. Apply any carve-out adjustments the pass file declares (e.g. `security` narrows it to trivial hygiene only; `docs` notes doc audits hit it often).

5. **Commit the filing** (when `auto-commit = true` from step 2 above). The filing's **last** write, so inline fixes land with the tickets. Stage by explicit pathspec only — `.flowtron/PLAN.md`, plus each inline-fix source path by name. **Never** `git commit -a`, `git add .`, or `git add -A`:

   ```sh
   git add .flowtron/PLAN.md [<inline-fix-path> ...]
   git diff --cached   # whole index, no pathspec
   git commit -m "chore: audit file tickets — <domain>"
   ```

   **Post-stage verification.** Read that staged diff before committing. Step 2's pre-check read the working tree and the index; the commit publishes the index, and a staged path can gain a foreign write in between — an editor autosave, a concurrent session — that `git add` then stages unseen. The read takes no pathspec because the commit takes none. Every hunk must be one this filing wrote: the appended ticket rows, and each §5 trivial inline fix. An unrecognized hunk → `git restore --staged` the staged pathspecs, skip the commit, and report it exactly as the `auto-commit = false` case below. Never unstage the foreign hunk and commit the rest. This audit's inline-fix carve-out makes the check wider here than on the other filing motions — a source path is far likelier than `PLAN.md` to be open in an editor while the audit runs.

   `<domain>` is the domain token resolved in §1. Commit only — never push. `auto-commit = false` → skip this step entirely and note it in the response (`left uncommitted (PLAN.md or the index already carried other changes)`). Full contract: `SPEC/plan-filing.md` §"Filing commits". Not a closure commit — report `committed <sha>` as plain text, **no 🏁** (`SPEC.md` §"Paper-complete guard" §3).

## 6. Hard rules

- **Targeted, not exhaustive.** A pass's cap — five by default, lower where the pass file sets one — is a *ceiling*, not a target. A clean pass gets zero findings and moves on, and a pass capped at one reports one.
- **Write tickets, not fixes.** `.flowtron/PLAN.md` gets updated (§5 above). Source files do NOT — any code change needs a separate explicit user request. Do not open files in edit mode for fixes, do not run formatters, do not "fix while I'm in here." **Exceptions:** the §5 trivial-fix carve-out, the scaffold-bootstrap fork-install carve-out below, plus any domain exception the pass file declares.
- **Fork-install carve-out (`scaffold-bootstrap.md` only).** The one write this skill may make outside `.flowtron/PLAN.md` is installing a fork of *itself* — `.claude/skills/audit/SKILL.md` plus its `.claude/commands/` wrapper, from `templates/audit-overlay-template.md`, and only on an explicit confirm at that fragment's step 4. It is an install, not a source edit: it touches nothing inside the scope resolved in §1 step 2. Never write it unprompted, never as a side effect of a run the operator started to get findings, and never overwrite an existing `.claude/skills/audit/`.
- **Every finding names an operator action.** A finding whose `Operator action:` line cannot be written — because no one could act on it, or because the action would be "look into it" / "consider whether" / "monitor this" — is **disqualified**: drop it, or reframe it until the action is concrete. This is a **detection filter, not a formatting rule** — it decides what counts as a finding at all, so apply it while forming the finding, not while writing it up. A disqualified item is an observation; if it is worth keeping, §4's *Exploratory Insights* is where observations belong, and a pass whose whole yield is observations reports zero findings.
- **Don't repeat the gates.** If a §1 verification gate (linter, type-checker, build tool, scanner) already flagged it, surface the aggregate once and move on — don't enumerate each gate row as a separate finding.
- **Don't audit adjacent code.** Stay inside the resolved scope.
- **Subroutine-safe.** Any domain may be invoked from another skill (notably `/ft-release` §7.1 → `/ft-audit docs`). When invoked as a subroutine with an explicit scope: skip §0 forker prompts, surface the report inline rather than blocking on `AskUserQuestion` for non-blocker items, and do **not** write PLAN.md tickets — the invoking skill is the orchestrator and owns per-finding decisions.
- **No final summary of what you just did.** The report + the committed PLAN.md diff (or the explicit zero-findings statement) *are* the deliverable — hand off with `committed <sha>` or the skip-on-dirt note, not a recap paragraph.
- The pass file's **specialist hard rules** are part of this contract — apply them as written.

## 7. Rationalizations

§6 states the rules; this section names the sentences an auditor uses to
get around them. Every rule above is skippable by an auditor that first
talks itself into skipping it — and an audit is exactly the run where
that happens, because you are already deep in someone else's code with
opinions about how to fix it.

Advisory prose, not a gate: nothing here is ticked or scored. Recognizing
your own draft sentence in the left column is the whole mechanism.

| The excuse | Why it's wrong | Refuted by |
|---|---|---|
| "This fix is one line — filing a ticket costs more than fixing it." | "Cheaper than filing" is not the test; the **skip-the-tasknote threshold** is. The trivial-fix carve-out is the one inline path and it has conditions (threshold met, presented under *Proposed inline fixes*, landed on the same write-step confirmation, recorded self-contained under `## Completed`). Meet them or file the ticket. | §5 trivial-fix carve-out |
| "I'm already in the file — fixing it now is obviously more efficient." | This is the "fix while I'm in here" the hard rule names verbatim. Efficiency is not the objection; **unrequested diffs in an audit the operator asked to be read-only** is. | §6 "Write tickets, not fixes" |
| "This pass found 8 genuine Critical issues — the cap would bury three of them." | The cap is not a gag. Keep the top 5 by severity and **state the tail** (`+3 more Critical omitted`) — the tail count is the disclosure mechanism, and a pass reporting five Criticals plus a tail is a louder signal than nine flat entries. | §2 |
| "It's technically outside the resolved scope, but it's clearly related." | Scope was resolved in §1 — and if it was ambiguous, the instruction was to **stop and ask**, not to widen silently. An audit whose footprint exceeds what was requested stops being reviewable. | §6 "Don't audit adjacent code"; §1 step 2 |
| "The report is thorough and the operator read it — writing PLAN tickets is bookkeeping." | §5 is titled *required, not optional* for this reason: **a report that gets forgotten isn't useful.** The tickets are the deliverable; the prose is the argument for them. | §5 |
| "Every pass returning findings looks more thorough than a pass returning none." | Five per pass is a **ceiling, not a target**. A clean pass gets zero and moves on. Padding to look thorough corrupts the severity scale for every real finding in the same report. | §6 "Targeted, not exhaustive" |
| "This one's too diffuse to write an action for, but the operator should know about it." | Then it is an **observation**, and §4 *Exploratory Insights* is the section that carries observations. Smuggling it in as a finding with a vague action ("review the error handling across the service") hands the operator something no agent can execute, which is the exact conversion failure the line exists to catch. | §6 "Every finding names an operator action"; §3 |
| "The action is obvious from the recommended fix — writing it out is duplication." | The two lines answer different questions: `Recommended fix:` is *what changes*, `Operator action:` is *the instruction that dispatches it*. If restating it is genuinely trivial, the cost is one sentence; if it is **not** trivial, you have just found a finding whose fix nobody can be told to make — which is the disqualification firing, not a redundancy. | §3; §6 "Every finding names an operator action" |
| "The linter flagged 30 of these, and each one is a real issue." | They are — collectively, once. Enumerating gate output as individual findings crowds out the analysis only a human-shaped read produces. Surface the aggregate and move on. | §6 "Don't repeat the gates" |
| "I was invoked as a subroutine, but these tickets are too valuable to drop." | Under subroutine invocation the **calling skill owns per-finding decisions**. Writing PLAN tickets from inside another skill's run puts filings on the board that its operator never approved. | §6 "Subroutine-safe" |
| "The scaffold is unfilled, but I can pick this project's conventions up from the code as I read it." | Inferring the rubric from the code under audit is the exact substitution the scaffold bootstrap exists to prevent — you would be grading the code against itself and calling the result a finding. Derivation reads what the project *declares* (manifests, CI config, rubric docs) and cites a source for every value; "I'll pick it up as I go" cites none. | §1 step 3; `scaffold-bootstrap.md` step 3 |
| "Prompting about the scaffold before I've found anything is friction — I'll audit first and note it in the summary." | Detection sits ahead of the rubric load and the gates deliberately: findings produced without contracts can't be re-graded afterward, and a caveat in the closing summary reaches the operator only after they've read five passes of generic advice. The stop is cheap precisely because it happens before the work. | §1 step 3 |
| "No project rubric turned up, so I'll audit against general best practices." | The rubric slot exists specifically to prevent that substitution — the job is auditing against **this project's** contracts. Missing rubric is a §1 step 6 *stop and ask*, not a licence to grade against generic style — and when the rubric slot is an unfilled *placeholder*, §1 step 3 has already routed you to `scaffold-bootstrap.md` rather than past it. | §1 steps 3, 4, 6; `scaffold-bootstrap.md` |

## 8. Red Flags

Symptoms an observer would notice, phrased from the outside because the
auditor exhibiting them is already convinced. A hit means re-read the
governing rule — it is not itself a finding, and it never goes in the
report.

- A file is open in edit mode and the change is neither the §5 trivial-fix
  carve-out nor a domain exception the pass file declares.
- A pass landed on exactly 5 findings and you either stopped looking or
  padded to get there.
- A finding's `Location:` sits outside the scope resolved in §1.
- The run is ending with no `.flowtron/PLAN.md` diff **and** without an
  explicit "zero findings across all passes" statement — **or** with a PLAN.md
  diff but no `committed <sha>` / skip-on-dirt note when §5 ran outside a
  subroutine invocation.
- A pass is running against a `passes/<domain>.md` whose `<…>` slots or
  `_(forker: …)_` notes are resolved by neither the pass file itself nor an
  overlay's `## Deltas`, and `scaffold-bootstrap.md` returned neither resolved
  values nor an explicit degraded-run acknowledgement.
- The scaffold bootstrap fired on a run whose overlay `## Deltas` block was
  fully filled — the exemption in its step 1 was skipped.
- A report is being written with no unfilled-scaffold banner even though the
  gates were never runnable and the rubric slots were never opened.
- A fork is being written into `.claude/skills/` and the bootstrap's confirm was
  never asked — or was asked and something already exists at that path.
- A derived gate command is about to run for a slot the loaded pass file
  never declared, or its intent is deploy / publish / release / migrate /
  seed / reset / push.
- An `Operator action:` line reads "investigate", "consider", "review",
  "keep an eye on", or names no actor — the finding was disqualified and got
  written up anyway.
- An `Operator action:` line is `Recommended fix:` reworded, with no actor and
  no dispatchable instruction.
- A "Why it matters" line would read identically in any codebase — a sign
  the project rubric was never loaded.
- A severity was assigned by feel and doesn't trace to the pass file's
  severity guide.
- You are running as a subroutine and drafting `AskUserQuestion` blockers or
  PLAN.md writes.
- A finding restates one row of linter/type-checker output you already
  surfaced in aggregate.
- You are composing a closing paragraph about what you just did, after the
  report and the PLAN.md diff are already written.
