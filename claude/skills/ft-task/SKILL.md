name: ft-task
description: Start a flowtron tasknote for a normal-sized, multi-step, or design-tradeoff-bearing task and drive it through the SPEC's 4-phase workflow. With `--debug` (`-d`), runs hypothesis-first for bugs. With `--loop`, iterates Phase 2/3 until a machine-checkable check passes. With `--fast` (`-f`), suppresses conditional gates. With `--unattended`, runs operator-less, parking at gates instead of asking.

# task — flowtron tasknote runner

You are starting a tasknote for the task ID provided in `args` (e.g., `CORE-004`). The full workflow contract lives in flowtron's `SPEC.md` — this skill is the executable interpretation, not a replacement. Treat SPEC.md as authoritative when this file is silent or in tension.

If `args` is missing or its first token doesn't match `<AREA>-<NUMBER>` (or `<AREA>-<NUMBER>.<SUB>` for epic subtasks), stop and ask the user for a valid task ID. Do not guess. Trailing `--fast` / `-f`, `--debug` / `-d`, `--loop`, and `--unattended` flags are the only other accepted tokens — see Step 0.

## Step 0 — Resolve paths

Two layouts. Pick by which file exists:

- **Adopter project:** `.flowtron/core/SPEC.md` exists → `<root>` = `.flowtron/core/`.
- **Flowtron self-host:** repo-root `SPEC.md` with heading `# Flowtron — Workflow Specification` → `<root>` = repo-root.

If neither matches, bail.

Paths this skill uses:
- SPEC: `<root>SPEC.md` (always loaded core)
- SPEC_DIR (lazy modules `epic.md` · `starter.md` · `blocked.md` · `model.md` · `loop.md` · `versioning.md` · `gate-postures.md` · `post-closure.md`): `<root>SPEC/`
- SKILL_DIR (lazy fragments `step-0-flags.md` · `step-1.5-model-edge.md` and `unattended-mode.md` — both shared, also loaded by `/ft-micro-task` — · `step-3a-promote-starter.md` · `step-3c-resume-blocked.md` · `step-4-debug-mode.md` · `step-5-loop-mode.md`): `<root>claude/skills/ft-task/`
- Template: `<root>templates/tasknote-template.md`
- PLAN: `.flowtron/PLAN.md`, tasknote dir: `.flowtron/tasknote/` (always)

Subsequent steps name what to Read; the SPEC contract + matching SKILL fragment typically load in parallel.

**Parse `args`.** Split on whitespace into `(TASK-ID, rest...)`. Initialize `fast-mode = false`, `debug-mode = false`, `loop-mode = false`, and `unattended-mode = false`. If `rest` is empty, continue to Step 1 — the default flow, which reads nothing further here. Otherwise **Read `<SKILL_DIR>/step-0-flags.md` now** and follow it: it walks `rest` as an unordered flag set, stops on any unrecognized token, emits one inline marker per active flag, defines the four modes, and dispatches the per-mode fragments (`step-4-debug-mode.md`; `step-5-loop-mode.md` + `<SPEC_DIR>/loop.md`; `unattended-mode.md` + `<SPEC_DIR>/blocked.md`); then continue to Step 1.

**When `unattended-mode = true`, the steps below do not restate the posture.** Every gate that would ask an operator — the Step 1.5 concrete-model STOP, the Step 4 drift carve-out, a destructive-action escalation or prerequisite ✋ `ACTION` in Phase 2, the Phase 3 👁️ ask, a queued in-📦 prompt at Step 6 — parks the tasknote instead, with the `park-reason:` code keyed to this skill's step in `<SKILL_DIR>/unattended-mode.md` §"Conversion map"; the Step 2 pre-flight checks terminate and write nothing (§"Pre-scaffold stops"). The posture sets `fast-mode = true` but does **not** inherit `--fast`'s two delegations — the 👁️ suppression and the Re-scope downgrade both park — and it relaxes neither the paper-complete guard nor the downstream-impact confirm (§"What `--unattended` never relaxes").

## Step 1 — Locate the task in PLAN.md

Read PLAN.md. Find the line containing `**<TASK-ID>**`. If the ID isn't in PLAN.md, stop and ask the user whether to add it or use a different ID. Do not invent an entry.

**Status gate (non-negotiable).** Before doing anything else, check the located line:

- If the line is checked (`- [x]`), or
- if it lives under the `## Completed` heading,

the task is already closed. **Stop. Do not scaffold.** Surface the conflict to the user and ask whether they meant a different task ID. Do this check by re-reading the exact PLAN.md line — never infer status from prior conversation context.

Otherwise, capture:

- The optional `[model]` segment (`[heavy]` / `[light]` primary recommended; specific names e.g. `opus` / `sonnet` / `grok` remain valid per SPEC §"Model field") — see Step 1.5
- The optional `| shortname` segment
- The one-line long description (everything after ` — `; may be empty)
- The section heading the line lives under (`High` / `Medium` / `Low` / `Future Opportunities`) — this is the task's **Priority**
- The optional `[!critical]` segment — sets the urgency flag (orthogonal to priority; floats the row to the top of High). Legacy `## Critical` sections are soft-migrated to `priority: 'High'` with the flag implicit (see SPEC §"Task-line format").
- The optional `[unattended]` marker (after `[model]`). **When present and no `--fast` / `--unattended` flag was passed**, set `fast-mode = true` and emit `⚡ --fast implied by the [unattended] row marker — same suppressions as --fast; the --unattended posture is not implied.` Then **Read `<SPEC_DIR>/gate-postures.md` now** — Step 0's flag walk did not run, so this branch loads the posture contract itself. The marker never sets `unattended-mode`; under an explicit `--unattended` it changes nothing. Contract: SPEC/gate-postures.md §"`--fast` operator override" → "Implied by the `[unattended]` row marker".

The full task-line grammar is `- [ ] **TASK-ID** [!critical] [model] [unattended] [handoff] | shortname — long description`; all of `[!critical]`, `[model]`, `[unattended]`, `[handoff]`, and `| shortname` are optional. `[handoff]` changes nothing on an attended run — capture nothing from it. See SPEC §"Task-line format" for the canonical grammar.

**Emit the 🎯 purpose blurb now** — before the model gate, the pre-flight checks, and any scaffold write, each of which can end the run:

```text
🎯 <TASK-ID> — <shortname>
<1-2 sentences of plain-English purpose.>
```

Two lines: the ID and the `| shortname`, then 1-2 sentences of purpose drawn from the PLAN.md long description just captured — the only source read yet. Emit it and keep going in the same turn; it fires once, here, ahead of the 3a / 3b / 3c branch. Bounds — not a cue, not a gate, suppressed by neither flag: `SPEC/purpose-blurb.md`.

**Filing-discipline check (advisory).** Word-count the captured long description (after `— `). If it exceeds the 70-word hard cap from SPEC/tasknote-selection.md §"PLAN.md filing-discipline thresholds", surface a one-line warning to the user:

```text
⚠️ PLAN.md description is <N> words (>70w cap). Should this have been filed
   as a starter? Proceeding with the existing line.
```

Informational only — do not block scaffolding; the task is already filed and reworking the filing now is too late. The warning nudges future filings.

**Completed-rotation check (advisory).** While PLAN.md is open, count the checked rows under `## Completed` (nested epic children included). If the count exceeds **60**, surface a one-line warning:

```text
⚠️ PLAN.md `## Completed` holds <N> rows (>60). Consider rotating the
   oldest rows to `.flowtron/PLAN-ARCHIVE.md`. Proceeding.
```

Informational only — never block, never rotate. Rotation is an operator motion; the bound, the month-block granularity, and the two never-split rules are canonical in SPEC/plan-filing.md §"`## Completed` rotation".

## Step 1.5 — Model gate (BEFORE scaffolding)

Gate on the `[model]` segment captured in Step 1 before any source reads — heavy thinking shouldn't run on the wrong model. The active model is whatever the assistant is currently running as (ask the user if uncertain). Which tags match which active models — concrete by exact identity, category by tier, and `[xheavy]` always under-tier — is canonical in `<SPEC_DIR>/model.md` §"Category-vs-concrete matching".

**Route on a verified tier, not an impression.** `Satisfied` is the only branch that proceeds *without* reading the module, so a wrong turn into it is the one verdict nothing downstream corrects. When the active model's tier is not certain against a category tag, read §"Category-vs-concrete matching" **before** choosing the branch, not after — a capable model one rung below its tag still routes to **Category under-tier**.

Branch on the verdict:

- **Satisfied** → proceed silently to Step 2.
- **Category under-tier** → Read `<SPEC_DIR>/model.md` + `<SKILL_DIR>/step-1.5-model-edge.md` in parallel, then follow that fragment's "Category under-tier" branch (⚠️ inline note, then proceed — not a STOP, not an auto-retag).
- **Concrete mismatch** → STOP. Read the same two in parallel, then follow the "Mismatch" branch.
- **Absent (legacy line)** → Read the same two in parallel, then follow the "Legacy entry" branch.

## Step 2 — Pre-flight checks & file-state branch

- Resolve the **Area** by reading the `.flowtron/tasknote/README.md` §"Archive layout" table — every task, every prefix, canonical ones included. `<area>` is **never derived from the task ID**: lowercasing the prefix is the adopter's declaration-time default, not a resolution you may perform, and a project may deliberately declare a folder it would not produce (`NAT-*` → `archive/natabula/`). See SPEC §"Task ID convention". If the table has no row for this prefix, stop and ask — do not guess a folder.
- **Epic-ID dispatch.** If the TASK-ID is `<AREA>-EPIC-<N>` (parent epic) or `<AREA>-<N>.<sub>` (epic subtask), Read `<SPEC_DIR>/epic.md` for the lifecycle contract before continuing. Plain `<AREA>-<N>` IDs do not load this module.
- **Foreign-dirt gate (paper-complete guard).** Before any scaffold / promote / resume writes, run `git status --porcelain`. If non-empty: **STOP**, surface the dirt list, ask the operator to commit / stash / discard themselves, then re-invoke. Do not auto-clean. See SPEC §"Paper-complete guard".
- If `.flowtron/tasknote/archive/<area>/<TASK-ID>.md` already exists: stop. The task is already closed and archived. Surface the conflict and ask whether the user meant a different task ID — do not scaffold a duplicate.
- Check `.flowtron/tasknote/<TASK-ID>.md`. **Four-way branch on the file's YAML `status:`:**
  - **`status: starter`** — starter tasknote awaiting promotion. Continue at **Step 3a (Promote a starter)**.
  - **`status: blocked`** — parked tasknote awaiting resume. Continue at **Step 3c (Resume a blocked tasknote)**.
  - **Any other `status:`** (`not-started` / `in-progress` / `completed`) — file is in flight or already closed. Stop. Tell the user the tasknote exists and recommend they continue conversationally (e.g., "continue CORE-004") rather than restarting. This skill is start-only by design. **When the session that started it is gone** — killed, out of context, an orchestrator's child that exited — "continue conversationally" is unreachable; name the park-then-resume path in `<SPEC_DIR>/blocked.md` §"Resuming an interrupted run" instead of stopping at the recommendation. It applies to `in-progress` only.
  - **File absent** — fresh scaffold path. Continue at **Step 3b (Scaffold a fresh tasknote)**.

## Step 3a — Promote a starter (existing file with `status: starter`)

Read `<SPEC_DIR>/starter.md` (lifecycle contract) and `<SKILL_DIR>/step-3a-promote-starter.md` (executable steps), then continue at **Step 4 (Phase 1: Discovery)**.

## Step 3b — Scaffold a fresh tasknote (no existing file)

**Sidequest-stub retirement.** If `.flowtron/sidequest/<TASK-ID>.md` exists, this scaffold is a sidequest promotion — delete it now (`rm .flowtron/sidequest/<TASK-ID>.md`). Contract: `claude/skills/ft-file-followup/park-mode.md` §Notes → "Promotion" ("Delete `.flowtron/sidequest/<ID>.md` after promotion"); this executes it at the point a promoting run actually writes, instead of relying on the promoter to remember a rule stated only in that fragment and `docs/GLOSSARY.md`.

Copy the template (path resolved in Step 0) to `.flowtron/tasknote/<TASK-ID>.md`. The frontmatter schema and body layout are canonical in SPEC §"Tasknote frontmatter" and §"Tasknote body shape" — fill them as specified there. The template ships the canonical phase checklists; leave them exactly as they ship.

**Skill-specific values at scaffold time:**

- `title:` — prefer the PLAN.md `| shortname` (Step 1) when present; otherwise derive from the long description.
- `status:` — `in-progress`.
- `created:` — today's date.
- `related-tasks:` — from PLAN.md if the line cites parent epics, predecessors, or follow-ups; otherwise `[]`.
- **Epic implementation-child YAML echo.** If the TASK-ID is `<AREA>-<N>.<sub>` and is *not* `.1` / `.N`, look at the sibling Discovery `.1` (active or archived) for a `## 🌳 Fan-out` section. Copy any Parallel / Sequential claim that names this child into omit-when-absent `blocked-by:` / `parallel-safe-with:` on *this* note (bare IDs; Sequential "after X" → `blocked-by: [X]`; Parallel peers → `parallel-safe-with`). Omit the keys when Fan-out does not name this child. A worktree copies only the child note, so the `.1` heading alone is not visible there. Contract: [`SPEC/epic.md`](../../../SPEC/epic.md) §"Fan-out." Do not invent a parser or a lock.

🎯 Goal is derived from the PLAN.md line at scaffold; ask the user if it's too terse for a clear one-sentence goal. ✅ Acceptance and 🧩 Subtasks are empty checklists at scaffold, populated during Phase 1 Discovery.

**When `loop-mode = true`**, apply the scaffold addendum in `<SKILL_DIR>/step-5-loop-mode.md` §"Step 3b" — the three additive `loop:` / `loop-max:` / `loop-last-run:` keys and the `## 🔁 Iterations` section.

Then continue at **Step 4 (Phase 1: Discovery)**.

## Step 3c — Resume a blocked tasknote (existing file with `status: blocked`)

Read `<SPEC_DIR>/blocked.md` (lifecycle contract) and `<SKILL_DIR>/step-3c-resume-blocked.md` (executable steps), then continue at **Step 5** at Phase 2 (the lazy fragment's step 5 directs there; Phase 1 is already complete on a parked tasknote).

Once the fragment has read the parked note, **name the `park-reason:` being cleared** in one plain prose line before Phase 2 starts. Phase 1 is already complete here, so the operator lands directly in Phase 2 with no Discovery to orient them, and the Step 1 blurb could not have known why the note was parked. Ordinary prose, not a second 🎯 emission.

## Step 4 — Phase 1: Discovery (drive now)

Work through the Phase 1 checklist per SPEC §"📝 Phase 1: Discovery". Re-scope and De-scope behavior is canonical there; the Re-scope-to-blocked path defers to `<SPEC_DIR>/blocked.md` (Read it if Discovery surfaces a real-but-blocked prerequisite).

**When `debug-mode = true`** (from Step 0): run the four hypothesis-first prompts from `<SKILL_DIR>/step-4-debug-mode.md` §"Phase 1" after the Relevance Assessment, recording answers in Discovery Notes. They sit *inside* this checklist — they add no box and no gate, and the exit-gate judgment below is unchanged.

Skill-specific imperatives on top of the SPEC contract:

- Tick boxes in the tasknote as you complete them.
- The first checklist item (Reviewed PLAN.md) is already done in Step 1 of this skill.
- For the Archive skim step: `ls .flowtron/tasknote/archive/<area>/` to enumerate, then for each source path in scope run `grep -l <path> .flowtron/tasknote/archive/<area>/*.md` (if YAML `touches:` is set, prefer those paths). Read the hits and log anything load-bearing in Discovery Notes (file moves, regressions, design decisions, hardlink notes, etc.). Also open IDs named by `## 🔗 Related`, YAML `supersedes:`, and any ⚠️ `Superseded by` pointer on those hits — still grep + read; no query engine. If `archive/<area>/` is empty or absent, **re-check `<area>` against the README table before believing it** — a derived-and-wrong folder is indistinguishable from a genuinely empty one, and mistaking the two silently voids this step against a full archive. Once the folder is confirmed, log "no prior tasknotes" and tick the box.
- For the Clarifying questions step: use AskUserQuestion for anything genuinely ambiguous. If nothing is ambiguous, write `No clarifications needed` in the tasknote with the explicit assumptions.
  **When `fast-mode = true`** (from Step 0): skip the AskUserQuestion call and write `No clarifications needed (--fast)` with the explicit assumptions the operator is asserting.
- For the `## ✅ Acceptance` population: name on each criterion the **verify command** that decides it — a test run, a lint/type-check, a `grep -q` on a contract file. A criterion no command decides marks itself `judgment` (or `👁️`) with a one-line reason; do not invent one. Phase 3 runs these and records the receipt. Contract: SPEC §"🧪 Phase 3: Testing & Linting". **When `loop-mode = true`**, the strict form in `<SKILL_DIR>/step-5-loop-mode.md` §"Step 4" applies instead — every criterion loop-verifiable, taste criteria split to a one-time post-loop 👁️ subsection, and a stop (drop `--loop`) when none is machine-checkable.
- For the "populate Subtasks" step: fill the tasknote's `## 🧩 Subtasks` checklist with concrete, ordered steps, and declare YAML `touches:` with the paths this task expects to edit. Contract — including which tasks are exempt and why it is never a gate: SPEC §"Tasknote frontmatter".
- Do not enter Phase 2 until every Phase 1 box is ticked. Once ticked, apply the SPEC/gates.md §"Phase 1→2 exit gate"'s **`default-skip` flavor** — the flavor `/ft-task` uses. That section's judgment rule is authoritative for which deviations skip and which fire; this skill only routes the two outcomes:
  - **Skip branch (default)** — emit the inline marker `✅ Phase 1 Discovery complete; entering Phase 2 Execution.` and start Step 5 Phase 2 immediately. Plain prose, not a banner; not a new gate.
  - **Fire branch** — surface the **🛠️ Phase 1→2 operator-gate cue** with the mandatory 1-2 sentence plain-English preview line (per SPEC/gates.md §"Operator-gate cues") and wait for the user's go (conversational assent — SPEC/cue-vocabulary.md §"Accepted gate replies") before starting Step 5 Phase 2.

  - **Re-scope under `fast-mode = true`** (not under `--unattended` — Step 0) — not a fire. Make the verdict's PLAN.md line + tasknote-header rewrite exactly as attended, emit `⚠️ Re-scope (--fast) — <what changed in the plan>; proceeding.` on its own line, then take the Skip branch's marker. De-scope still fires.

  Record the judgment inline at the exit ("Discovery surfaced no significant deviation → skip 🛠️." or "Discovery surfaced <one-line reason> → fire 🛠️." or "Discovery landed Re-scope → ⚠️ notice (--fast).") so the operator can spot misjudgments in the transcript.

**`--fast` interaction.** On a `Proceed` verdict with `fast-mode = true`, the clarifying-questions step writes `No clarifications needed (--fast)` and the Skip branch fires; the drift carve-out above is canonical in SPEC/gates.md §"Phase 1→2 exit gate" → Flag interaction.

## Step 5 — Phases 2-4 (drive conversationally)

After the Phase 1→2 cue clears, Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 closure ops
flow continuously without an intermediate gate. The next operator-gate
cue is the 📦 ready-to-commit banner in Step 6.

**When `loop-mode = true`**, Phase 2 and Phase 3 below are replaced by the inline execute→verify loop in `<SKILL_DIR>/step-5-loop-mode.md` §"Step 5" (per-cycle relevance gate, commit-per-verified-iteration, `loop-max` soft stop, destructive-step park), followed by its §"Step 6" one-time 👁️ ask; then Phase 4 closure and Step 6 below run unchanged, on the Skip branch since the loop ran under `--fast` semantics.

- **Phase 2: Execution** — pattern survey first (look at sibling modules / parallel components for an existing shape to extend; justify a new shape if none fits), check DRY and single-responsibility boundaries, and prefer composition when it reduces coupling. Implement minimally; refactor only for Acceptance or to prevent duplication, obscured responsibility, or a dependency-boundary violation, recording the reason and deferring unrelated cleanup. Then run targeted tests on changed files. Tick boxes as you go. **If a hard dependency surfaces mid-execution**, Read `<SPEC_DIR>/blocked.md` and park the tasknote per its contract — flip `status: blocked`, update the nav header to `⏸ Blocked`, write `park-reason: dependency — <the dependency>` (mandatory under `--unattended`, recommended otherwise), and stop. The next `/ft-task <ID>` invocation enters the resume path (Step 3c) automatically. **If a direction-changing decision surfaces mid-execution** — one whose effect reaches *beyond* the current task (approach, contract, data model, sequencing) — run the **downstream-impact reconciliation scan** before continuing; a decision whose effect stays inside the task skips it. SPEC/tasknote-selection.md §"Downstream-impact reconciliation" is authoritative for triggers, steps, impact classes, and reconcile actions. Its user-confirm is an inline review prompt, **not** a banner, and it fires regardless of `fast-mode` — it guards plan correctness, and the user owns the confirm.
- **Phase 3: Testing & Linting** — targeted tests, lint/type-check, and the **Verification receipt** box for changed code (each Acceptance verify command recorded in Testing Notes as `command → exit code` with the first failure line when non-zero, alongside the canonical structural quality assertions folded into the same box); visual confirmation for frontend changes (emphasized `👁️ **CONFIRM**` ask — its own line, blank-line isolated, bold label — per SPEC §"🧪 Phase 3: Testing & Linting"; emphasis raised *within* the inline shape, still not a banner block). Run the full suite only for broad/cross-cutting changes. Flows directly into Phase 4 closure ops; no gate between them. **When `fast-mode = true`** (from Step 0; not under `--unattended` — Step 0), suppress the 👁️ CONFIRM prose ask — lint/type-check on changed code still runs, but the operator owns the visual-confirmation responsibility. **When `debug-mode = true`**, apply the Phase 2 emphasis and run the Phase 3 repro re-verify from `<SKILL_DIR>/step-4-debug-mode.md` — re-execute the exact minimal repro from Phase 1 and record the outcome in Testing Notes. The re-verify runs **even under `--fast`**; a still-failing repro sends you back to Phase 2 with updated hypotheses, not to closure.
- **Phase 4: Closure (auto-run)** — run the closure ops per SPEC §"🚀 Phase 4: Closure", which is authoritative for all of them: the doc-drift sweep across `.flowtron/tasknote/README.md` §"AI-referenced docs", the `## ✅ Acceptance` tick-through, the YAML `status:` flip *before* the archive move, the PLAN.md stub-form flip and its standalone-vs-epic-child placement, the archive move, the conditional superseded-claim pointer, and the evidence-based recap — whose `touches:` scope reconciliation (`git diff --name-only` vs declared) is a recorded fact that never re-opens a phase, per SPEC §"🚀 Phase 4: Closure". Skill-specific on top of it: flip **only this task's** PLAN.md line — ban collateral Completed flips — and per SPEC §"Paper-complete guard" do not flip or move anything unless the deliverable paths can stage in the same atomic closure commit this turn. **Do not surface a banner here** — the recap bundles into Step 6's 📦 gate, and stays recap-only: the next-task suggestion lands after the commit, in Step 6.

## Step 6 — Post-closure protocol

**Read `<SPEC_DIR>/post-closure.md` now** — the protocol is a lazy module, loaded here and nowhere earlier — then run its three-step protocol (commit / suggest next move / copy-paste line) under SPEC §"Paper-complete guard", branching on SPEC/gates.md §"Conditional skip rule" against the closure diff. Stage **deliverable paths + PLAN + archive** together; refuse a Completed-only commit when Acceptance requires non-workflow deliverables.

- **Skip branch** (signals clear, no bundled in-📦 prompt) — run that section's **autonomous-commit motion** end to end, naming the cleared signal in its marker as diff facts (e.g., `4 markdown files; no privileged-ops surface`). Before 🏁, verify `git show --name-only` covers the deliverables; never invent a SHA.
- **Fire branch** (privileged-ops signal hits OR bundled in-📦 prompt queued) — run its **bundled-approval motion**: surface the 📦 gate and wait for commit-go (SPEC/cue-vocabulary.md §"Accepted gate replies"). The 🏁 marker — carrying a 1-2 sentence accomplishment summary — plus next-move and copy-paste land only in the later post-commit response.

**`--fast` override.** Canonical in SPEC/gates.md §"Conditional skip rule" → Flag overrides and SPEC/gate-postures.md §"`--fast` operator override": `--fast` forces Skip regardless of signal trips (naming the suppressed signals in the marker). Two things it does not reach: the Step 4 drift carve-out upstream, and the paper-complete guard here — 🏁 still requires a real deliverable-covering SHA.

Skill-specific:
- Suggest-next-move: run `SPEC/post-closure.md` step 2 as written — the **fresh PLAN.md re-read** (never the Step 1 cached parse), the unchecked-and-open-section verification that drops failing candidates, the **PLAN exhausted (terminal)** form when none survives, the emoji-primary-label print, and the 🔍 prefix on `/ft-audit*` candidates. On the terminal form, skip the copy-paste line below: there is nothing to run after a clear.
- Copy-paste helper: run `SPEC/post-closure.md` step 3 as written — the glyph copied from the chosen candidate line, the own-line inline-code invocation with no trailing punctuation, and the 👇 `Run in this session:` exception for context-dependent skills. Here `<args>` is the next task ID and the invocation line is `` `/ft-task <next-ID>` ``.

## Notes

- **Sub-tasks of an epic** (`<AREA>-<NUMBER>.<SUB>`) follow the same flow. The parent epic line in PLAN.md is not flipped to complete until all children are. For code-sweep / multi-child feature epics, the first subtask (`.1`) is typically a **Discovery** task — its deliverable is the filed child task list in PLAN.md, not code — and the final subtask is an **Audit** task that verifies the completed epic sits well in the codebase. Full lifecycle in `<SPEC_DIR>/epic.md` (loaded at Step 2 for epic IDs).
- **Skip-the-tasknote cases** (single-line typo, formatting tweak, ~10-line doc patch, trivial config edit) — see SPEC/tasknote-selection.md §"When to use a tasknote (and when not to)". For these, decline to scaffold and tell the user to make the edit directly.
