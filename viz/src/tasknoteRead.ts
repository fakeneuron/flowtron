// Read every `*.md` tasknote directly inside `dir`. Shared by
// `devApi.createActiveHandler` (the active `.flowtron/tasknote/` dir) and
// `archiveCache.readArchive` (one archive area dir per call): both need the
// identical readdir → containment → parse → drop loop, and a leaf module keeps
// them from importing each other.
//
// `realBase` must be the project root already resolved through symlinks (via
// `safeRealpath`), never `dir` itself. Anchoring containment on the leaf
// directory would be vacuous: if `tasknote/` (or `archive/`, or `.flowtron/`)
// is itself a symlink, everything under its target is trivially "inside" it, so
// only the root is a meaningful bound. Symlinked project roots stay legitimate:
// the root resolves first, then nothing below it may escape.
// Callers resolve the root and handle its `null` themselves because TypeScript
// cannot narrow a captured `string | null` inside the `files.map` closure.
//
// Two silent per-file drops, both deliberate, neither fatal to the listing:
//   * resolves outside the project root — no user action possible;
//   * unreadable or malformed — legacy archived tasknotes may carry malformed
//     YAML frontmatter (write-once policy in SPEC.md) and a TOCTOU delete
//     between readdir and readFile is routine during live editing. Per-file
//     warnings would be a wall of noise on every `npm run dev` for anyone with
//     old adopter checkouts.
//
// The parsed note records the pre-realpath `path`, matching what callers show
// the operator; the resolved path is used only to read the bytes.
