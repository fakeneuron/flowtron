# brand/

This project's public identity kit — four files with fixed names, so any
consumer can copy them without asking what they are called here.

| File | What | Minimum |
|---|---|---|
| `BRAND.md` | The blurb: `tagline` / `one_liner` / `description` front-matter + free body | Three fields filled |
| `logo.svg` | The mark, transparent ground | Legible at 32 px; no embedded raster |
| `favicon.svg` | Tab icon (optional `favicon.png` fallback, not counted) | Square; reads at 16 px |
| `promo-16x9.webp` | One hero still for cards, link previews, posts | 1600 × 900 |

`PROMPTS.md` is provenance for mined or generated assets (origin date,
optional model, per-asset source path or prompt, what not to change).
Present, **not counted** — same class as this README, never a fifth kit
file.

Only `BRAND.md` and this README are deposited; the three assets and
`PROMPTS.md` are yours to add when the kit is filled. Presence of the
four counted files is reported (never enforced) by an operator-side drift
tool. Standard (operator-private): `~/Code/natabula/docs/DESIGN-STANDARDS.md`
§"Brand kit" — this README is the self-contained contract.
